# This folder is for YOUR symlinks to favorite experts

Example setup:
```bash
ln -s ../pro-os/experts/denny-systems-architect.md denny.md
ln -s ../pro-os/experts/ada-implementation.md ada.md
ln -s ../pro-os/experts/lyna-external-strategy.md lyna.md
```

Symlinks you create won't be tracked in git (see .gitignore).
This keeps your setup personal!
