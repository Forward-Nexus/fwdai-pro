**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/analyze.md`

This command provides a structured approach for analyzing codebases, systems, documents, strategies, or any other subject requiring deep evaluation and insights.

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at Post-Flight phase:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/quality-checklist.md` (validate analysis deliverable)

**If analysis includes research:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md` (cite sources properly)

## Key Principles

- **Token Efficiency:** Check context before loading files
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight (scope) → Execution (analyze) → Post-Flight (validate with checklist & deliver insights)
- **Expert Integration:** Works with any expert based on analysis domain
- **Quality Validation:** Analysis deliverable must pass quality checklist
