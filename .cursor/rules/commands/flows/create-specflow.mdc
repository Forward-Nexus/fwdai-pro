# @create-specflow Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@create-specflow`

**This rule loads the TDD-enforced specification creation flow**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/flows/create-specflow.md`

This flow command creates comprehensive technical specifications with **mandatory TDD enforcement** and structured quality phases.

---

## When to Use This

✅ **Use `@create-specflow` when:**
- Building new features that need technical specification
- Want TDD enforced (tests first, always)
- Need bulletproof quality requirements
- Implementing code (not content/strategy)

❌ **Use `@create` instead when:**
- Flexible content creation needed
- Strategy documents
- Campaigns/pitches
- No strict TDD requirements

---

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at Post-Flight phase:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/spec-checklist.md` (REQUIRED - no exceptions)
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md` (if making claims)

---

## Key Principles

- **TDD Enforcement:** Tests defined BEFORE implementation (non-negotiable)
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight → Execution → Post-Flight (MANDATORY quality phase)
- **Expert Integration:** Works best with Denny or Ada
- **Quality First:** `spec-checklist.md` MUST be validated at end (no shipping without passing)
