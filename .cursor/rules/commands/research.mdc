# @research Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@research`

**This rule loads the research command workflow**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/research.md`

This command provides a structured approach for conducting research - market analysis, technical exploration, competitive intelligence, or any investigation requiring deep information gathering.

---

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at start:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md` (REQUIRED for all research)

**For investor/market research:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/patterns/market-research-workflow.md` (research-first workflow for investor materials)

**Load at Post-Flight:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/quality-checklist.md` (validate deliverable)

## Key Principles

- **Token Efficiency:** Check context before loading files
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight (define scope) → Execution (research & synthesize) → Post-Flight (document findings & validate citations)
- **Expert Integration:** Works with research-oriented experts (Lyna for market, Denny for technical, Benji for operations)
- **Citation Standards:** MUST follow `research-citation-standards.md` (three-tier system, no fake citations)
