## üîß Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

- **Discuss first** for anything non-trivial
- **One feature/fix per PR** - Keep changes focused
- **Update documentation** if you change behavior
- **Test thoroughly** - Especially for non-software use cases

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR, please test:

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run tests (if available)
npm run test
