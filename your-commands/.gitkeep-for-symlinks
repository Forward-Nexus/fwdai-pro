# This folder is for YOUR symlinks to favorite commands

Example setup:
```bash
ln -s ../pro-os/commands/quick/create-spec.md create-spec.md
ln -s ../pro-os/commands/quick/create-feature.md create-feature.md
ln -s ../pro-os/commands/quick/rt.md rt.md
ln -s ../pro-os/commands/system/update-project.md update-project.md
```

Symlinks you create won't be tracked in git (see .gitignore).
This keeps your setup personal!
