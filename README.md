## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install FWD PRO in your project
npx @fwd-ai/pro install

# Answer 14-19 questions (depends on what you're building)
# FWD PRO sets up everything automatically
```

That's it! You now have a team of AI experts ready to help.

### 🔄 Keeping FWD PRO Updated

```bash
# Update to the latest version (preserves all your data)
npx @fwd-ai/pro update
```

Updates work like app updates - your documents, workspace, and settings are automatically preserved while system files are updated.

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Your Dashboard**
All work happens in one place - the **Roundtable**. Read just TWO files:

- **`roundtable/whiteboards.md`** - Current work, expert collaboration, project status
- **`roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md`** - Your action items and decisions needed

No hunting through folders. Everything visible.

### **Smart Organization**
- **Workspaces** for active collaboration - experts work together here
- **Documents** for finished deliverables - clean outputs organized by type
- **System learns** - the more you organize it your way, the better AI understands your preferences

### **Expert Collaboration**
Multiple specialized experts collaborate transparently:
- You see all discussions, handoffs, and decisions
- Experts coordinate automatically
- Every deliverable reviewed by relevant experts
- Clear handoffs and accountability

## ✨ What Makes FWD PRO Different

### 🌍 **Universal**
Works for ANY business - not just software. Restaurant? Law firm? Telecom? FWD PRO adapts to your industry.

### 🏗️ **Structured, Not Scattered**
Not just chat - actual deliverables with clear workflows. Drafts in workspaces, finals in documents, everything tracked.

### 👥 **Multiple Expert Perspectives**
Not one AI - a team of specialists who collaborate. See architecture, implementation, legal, marketing views on everything.

### 📊 **Organization That Learns**
The system adapts to YOUR organization style. The more you customize folder structures and preferences, the better it understands how you work.

### 🎨 **Adapts to You**
Choose communication styles, set technical level, work via voice or text. System adjusts to YOUR workflow, not vice versa.

### 🔍 **Complete Transparency**
See all expert discussions, handoffs, and decision-making. Nothing hidden - you're in the room for everything.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### **The Roundtable**
All experts work together in one place. Like a team meeting where everyone contributes and you can see all the work happening.

### **Workspaces**
Each deliverable gets a workspace where experts collaborate. When done, it's archived and the clean output goes in `documents/`.

### **Your Profile**
FWD PRO learns how YOU work:
- Communication preferences
- Technical expertise level
- Working style and tools
- Industry and domain focus

Experts adapt to YOU, not the other way around.

### **Work-Based Activation**
FWD PRO activates experts based on what you're doing:
- Building something? → Denny + Ada activated
- Raising money? → Lyna activated
- Marketing? → Benji activated
- Legal needs? → Elle activated

You only see what you need.
