All experts work together in one place. Like a team meeting where everyone contributes and you can see all the work.

### Your Profile
FWD PRO learns how YOU work:
- Communication style

- Working preferences (ADHD, dictation, visual, etc.)
- Industry focus

Experts adapt to YOU.

### Work Types
FWD PRO activates experts based on what you're doing:
