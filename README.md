## 📊 How It Works

### 🪑 **The Roundtable - Your Conference Room**

**Imagine a conference room with your expert team:**
- **Whiteboards on the wall** - Project dashboard (Monday.com-style)
- **Your clipboard** - Action items (ticket-style, scannable)
- **Expert notebooks** - AI context (you never read these)
- **Documents folder** - Final deliverables

### **Your Dashboard (What YOU Read)**
Read just TWO files to see everything:

1. **`roundtable/whiteboards.md`** - Project status dashboard
   - What each expert is working on
   - Current status and blockers
   - High-level overview

2. **`roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md`** - Your action items
   - Ticket-style format (scannable!)
   - Things YOU need to do
   - Created by experts when they need you

### **Smart Organization**
- **Workspaces** - AI-optimized context (experts use these, you don't!)
- **Whiteboards** - Human-readable dashboard (everyone reads)
- **Checklist** - Your tickets (clean, visual, actionable)
- **Documents** - Final deliverables (organized by type)

### **Expert Collaboration (v2.1)**
Multiple specialized experts collaborate naturally:
- ✅ **Group chat style** - Experts discuss with each other (not sequential handoffs!)
- ✅ **Research verified** - All claims backed by real sources (no made-up stats)
- ✅ **Token efficient** - Iterate in chat before writing docs (saves money)
- ✅ **Natural conversation** - Just talk about your project, AI updates context
- ✅ **Cross-validated** - Experts check each other's work

### 🌍 **Universal**
Works for ANY business - not just software. Restaurant? Law firm? Telecom? FWD PRO adapts to your industry.

### 🪑 **The Roundtable Model**
Not just chat - a conference room with your expert team. Clear organization: whiteboards for status, checklist for actions, documents for deliverables.

### 👥 **Expert Orchestrators (Not "Agents")**
Not generic AI or task-running agents - named experts with personalities who collaborate naturally. They discuss, cross-validate, and coordinate like real people.

### 📊 **Organization That Learns**
The system adapts to YOUR organization style. Just talk about your project naturally - AI updates context automatically (with your permission).

### 🎨 **Adapts to You**
Choose communication styles, set technical level, work via voice or text. System adjusts to YOUR workflow, not vice versa.

### 🔍 **Complete Transparency**
See all expert discussions, handoffs, and decision-making. Nothing hidden - you're in the room for everything.

### 🔬 **Research Integrity (v2.1)**
All statistics and claims backed by REAL sources. No made-up research. Experts verify with web search before citing data.

Project dashboard showing what each expert is working on. High-level status, blockers, progress. Human-readable, Monday.com-style.

AI-optimized context files with decisions, thread references, and collaboration notes. You DON'T read these - just ask experts in chat if you need info!

### **Checklist (YOU Read)**
Your action items in ticket format. Scannable, visual, minimal text. Only things YOU need to do.

### **Your Profile**
FWD PRO learns how YOU work:
- Communication preferences
- Technical expertise level
- Working style and tools
- Industry and domain focus

Experts adapt to YOU, not the other way around.

### **Work-Based Shortcuts**
FWD PRO creates quick-access shortcuts based on what you're doing:
- Building something? → Denny + Ada get shortcuts
- Raising money? → Lyna gets a shortcut
- Marketing? → Benji gets a shortcut
- Legal needs? → Elle gets a shortcut

All experts are always available - shortcuts just make the most relevant ones easier to find.
