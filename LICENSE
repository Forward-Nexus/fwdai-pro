ATTRIBUTION & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

FWD PRO was inspired by and learned from excellent prior work:

- BMAD-METHOD™ (https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) by BMad Code, LLC
  Learned from: Quality systems, workflow patterns, story-based collaboration,
  and structured project management approaches.

- Agent-OS (https://github.com/coleam00/agent-os) by CasJam Media LLC
  Learned from: Context management, three-phase workflows, pre/post-flight 
  patterns, and conditional context loading.

FWD PRO builds on these concepts but takes a different approach focused on 
universal applicability (any business type), expert collaboration (vs 
task-driven), and founder accessibility (vs developer-centric). We built 
our own implementation from their conceptual inspiration.
