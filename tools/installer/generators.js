## Don't Need Code Yet?

If you're working on:
- **Investor materials** - Pitch decks, business plans, financial models
- **Marketing content** - Social posts, campaigns, brand guidelines  
- **Legal documents** - Terms, policies, contracts
- **Strategy & planning** - Roadmaps, processes, documentation

You might not need a traditional "tech stack" yet. But here's what you ARE using:

### Documentation & Writing
- **Markdown** - Simple text formatting (what this file is!)
- **Google Docs / Notion** - Collaborative writing
- **Obsidian / Roam** - Advanced note-taking

### Design & Presentations
- **Figma** - UI/UX design, prototypes
- **Canva** - Quick graphics and social media
- **Google Slides / Keynote** - Presentations
- **Adobe Creative Suite** - Professional design

### Project Management
- **Linear / Jira** - Task tracking for dev teams
- **Notion / Airtable** - Flexible databases
- **Google Sheets** - Spreadsheets and simple data

---

## Need to Build Something?

Here's where traditional tech stacks come in.

### 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

**Building a mobile app?**
→ React Native (one codebase, iOS + Android)
→ OR Flutter (if you want native performance)

**Building a website?**
→ Static site: Next.js + Vercel (fast, free hosting)
→ Dynamic site: Next.js + Supabase (user accounts, database)

**Building a web app (like Gmail)?**
→ React + TypeScript + Supabase
→ OR Next.js + PostgreSQL

**Building an API/backend?**
→ Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
→ OR Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL

**Building a prototype fast?**
→ Start with No-Code: Bubble, Webflow, Glide
→ Then graduate to: React + Supabase

---

## 🚀 Popular Tech Stack Combos (2024)

### The Modern Startup Stack
**Best for:** SaaS products, web apps, MVPs
\`\`\`
Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

AI Tools: Cursor, v0.dev, Claude
\`\`\`
**Why:** Fast to build, scales well, free tier available

### The Mobile-First Stack
**Best for:** Mobile apps (iOS + Android)
\`\`\`
App: React Native + TypeScript + Expo

Styling: Tailwind CSS (AI-friendly)
IDE: Cursor (AI-native code editor)
AI: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GitHub Copilot
\`\`\`
**Why:** AI works best with popular, well-documented tools

### The Bootstrap Stack
**Best for:** Solo founders, tight budgets
\`\`\`
Frontend: Next.js

## 🧩 Tech Stack Components Explained

### Frontend (What Users See)
- **React** - Most popular, huge community, lots of jobs
- **Next.js** - React + routing + SEO + server features
- **Vue.js** - Easier to learn than React, great docs
- **Svelte** - Fast, modern, less code

### Backend (The Server/API)
- **Node.js** - JavaScript on the server (use same language everywhere)
- **Python** - Easy to read, great for AI/ML
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-service (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Firebase** - Google's backend service (good for mobile)

### Database (Where Data Lives)
- **PostgreSQL** - Most popular, powerful, open-source
- **MySQL** - Also popular, simpler than Postgres
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL, flexible schema (good for prototypes)
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL with easy API and auth built-in

### Mobile
- **React Native** - JavaScript, one codebase for iOS + Android
- **Flutter** - Google's framework, fast performance
- **Swift (iOS)** - Native iOS only, best performance
- **Kotlin (Android)** - Native Android only, best performance

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility classes, fast development
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS, no conflicts
- **Styled Components** - CSS in JavaScript
- **Sass/SCSS** - Advanced CSS with variables

---

## 💡 How to Choose

### Consider Your Situation

**If you're non-technical:**
→ Start with No-Code tools (Webflow, Bubble)
→ Graduate to React + Supabase when you outgrow them

**If you can code with AI:**
→ Use popular tools with great docs (React, Next.js, Supabase)
→ AI works best with mainstream tech

**If you're a developer:**
→ Use what you already know
→ Don't learn a new stack unless necessary

**If you're hiring developers:**
→ Choose popular tech (easier to find talent)
→ React > Vue > Svelte (by job market size)

### Consider Your Project

**Need it fast?**
→ Use frameworks with batteries included (Next.js, Supabase)

**Need it cheap?**
→ Use free tiers (Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare)

**Need it scalable?**
→ PostgreSQL + Node.js or Python + proper hosting

**Need it simple?**
→ Fewer tools = less complexity
→ Next.js + Supabase covers 80% of use cases

---

## 🎓 Learning Resources

'You prefer **detailed explanations** - your experts will provide thorough context!' : 'Your experts will adapt to your preferred communication style!'}

### When to Tag Experts
- **@genna** - Strategy, vision, roadmap, team coordination
- **@denny** - System design, architecture, technical specs
- **@ada** - Code implementation, technical execution
${aboutProject.workTypes.includes('investor') ? '- **@lyna** - Fundraising, pitch decks, investor relations\n' : ''}${aboutProject.workTypes.includes('marketing') ? '- **@benji** - Marketing, growth, operations\n' : ''}${aboutProject.workTypes.includes('legal') ? '- **@elle** - Legal, compliance, contracts\n' : ''}${aboutProject.domainExpert ? `- **@${aboutProject.domainExpert.expertName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}** - ${aboutProject.domainExpert.domain}\n` : ''}
### Best Practices
1. **Be specific** - The more context you give, the better the output
2. **Check the roundtable** - See what's in progress in \`0-roundtable/\`
3. **Review deliverables** - Found in \`.fwdpro/documents/\`
4. **Update your KB** - Keep \`project-kb.md\` current as things evolve

## My Workflow (Consistent Across Projects)

**📚 Workspace & Whiteboard Guide:** See [workspace-workflow-guide.md](../../system/standards/workspace-workflow-guide.md) for complete standards.

### Every Time I'm Activated:

**Step 1: Load Context** (Efficiently - don't re-read files already in context!)
- Check if already in context: \`project/founder-profile.md\`, \`project/project-kb.md\`, \`project/mission.md\`, \`project/people.md\`
- Read \`roundtable/whiteboards.md\` (current work overview)
- Check relevant \`roundtable/workspace/\` files for work I'm reviewing
- Load context only as needed (token efficiency!)

**Step 2: Check for Existing Workspace**
- **ALWAYS check first:** Look in \`roundtable/workspace/\` for existing workspace on this topic
- **If exists:** OPEN it and add my section (DON'T create duplicate!)
- **If reviewing existing work:** Open that workspace, add ${domain.toLowerCase()} review section
- **If creating ${domain.toLowerCase()} content:** Create ONE comprehensive workspace
- **Naming:** \`topic-name-complete.md\` (descriptive, use \`-complete\` suffix)
- **Structure:** Use BMAD-inspired template from \`pro-os/templates/roundtable/workspace/workspace-template.md\`

**Step 3: Do the ${domain} Work**
- **Search for current ${domain.toLowerCase()} best practices** (check what year it is!)
- Review materials through ${domain.toLowerCase()} lens
- Apply industry standards and best practices
- Provide clear, actionable ${domain.toLowerCase()} guidance
- Document my review/guidance IN workspace

**Step 4: Update Whiteboards**
Update MY detailed whiteboard section in \`roundtable/whiteboards.md\` (not the summary table):

**Status Emojis:**
- ⚪ Draft
- ✅ Approved
- 🔄 InProgress
- 📋 Review
- ✅ Done

\`\`\`markdown
## ${icon} ${firstName}'s Whiteboard (${domain} Expert)

### Active Work
- **[Workspace Title]** - [emoji] [Status]
  - Workspace: [link](workspace/workspace-name.md)
  - Deliverable: [link](../documents/category/file.md)
  - ${domain} Status: [Clear / Needs Review / Concerns]
  - Quick note: [One-line current state]
  - Next: [What's next]

### Completed This Month
- ✅ [Work item] - [date] - [Brief outcome]
\`\`\`

**Step 5: Create Clean Deliverables (If Creating ${domain} Content)**
Save ${domain.toLowerCase()} materials in \`documents/\` - AI organizes intuitively:
- ${domain} guidelines → \`documents/[appropriate-category]/\`
- Update existing files directly (don't create v2 versions!)
- Founder can override location anytime

**Step 6: Update Founder Checklist (If Needed)**
If founder needs to address ${domain.toLowerCase()} concerns, add to \`roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md\` (use table format)
