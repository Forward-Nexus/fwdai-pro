## üìã What Are Workspaces?

**Workspaces are comprehensive progress documents inspired by BMAD Method story documents.**

### Key Principles:

1. **ONE workspace per major topic** - Consolidate, don't fragment
2. **COMPREHENSIVE** - Include ALL related work, decisions, context
3. **BMAD-Inspired Structure** - Story, AC, Tasks, Expert Collaboration
4. **Living Documents** - Update as work progresses
5. **Can be LONG** - That's the point! Full context preserved

### Workspace Structure (BMAD-Inspired):

```markdown
## Status - Track workflow progression
## Story - "As a/I want/so that" OR "Problem/Solution/Benefit"
## Acceptance Criteria - What "done" looks like
## Tasks/Subtasks - Breakdown with AC references
## Expert Collaboration - Your work + handoffs
## Key Decisions - Decision log with rationale
## Blockers & Issues - Track what's preventing progress
## Quality Review - Formal QA before Done
## Completion Summary - Wrap-up and lessons learned
```

## üîÑ Expert Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Existing Workspace

**Before creating a new workspace, ALWAYS check if one exists:**

```bash
# Look in 0-roundtable/workspace/
# Search for topic-related files
```

**If workspace exists:**
- OPEN it and ADD your section
- DON'T create a second workspace for the same topic

**If no workspace exists:**
- Create ONE comprehensive workspace
- Name it descriptively: `topic-name-complete.md`
- Use template: `pro-os/templates/roundtable/workspace/workspace-template.md`

---

### Step 2: Add Your Expert Section

**Every expert gets their own section in the workspace:**

```markdown
### {{Your Name}}'s Work

**Role:** [Your specific contribution]  
**Date:** {{date}}  
**Status Update:** [Current state]

**Work Completed:**
[Detailed notes - can be LONG! That's good!]

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Decision 1 with rationale
- Decision 2 with rationale

**Research & References:**
- Best practices researched
- Resources consulted

**Progress on Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Task X - Complete
- üîÑ Task Y - In progress

**Notes & Context:**
[Important context for future collaborators]
```

**Your section can be as LONG as needed** - include ALL:
- Work you did
- Research you performed
- Decisions you made and WHY
- Options you considered
- Context others need to understand

---

### Step 3: Hand Off Work (If Applicable)

**When passing work to another expert:**

```markdown
### Handoff to {{Next Expert}}

Hey {{expert}}! [Brief status]

**Complete Context:**
[LONG context dump - everything they need]

**What's Been Done:**
- ‚úÖ Item 1 (AC: #)
- ‚úÖ Item 2 (AC: #)

**What You Need to Do:**
- [ ] Next step 1 (AC: #, Task: #)
- [ ] Next step 2 (AC: #, Task: #)

**Important Considerations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Thing to watch for
- üí° Helpful tip

**Resources:**
- File/link 1: [location]
- File/link 2: [location]

**Questions?** Tag me! - {{your name}}
```

**Handoffs should be COMPLETE, not brief** - err on side of too much context.

---

### Step 4: Update Status & Tasks

**As you work, update the workspace:**

1. **Status Section** - Check off workflow progression
2. **Tasks Section** - Check off completed tasks
3. **Change Log** - Add entry for your updates

```markdown
## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] InProgress ‚Üê **CURRENT** ({{your name}} working)
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done
```

```markdown
## Tasks
- [x] Task 1 - Complete by {{your name}}
- [x] Task 2 - Complete by {{your name}}
- [ ] Task 3 - Assigned to {{next expert}}
```

---

### Step 5: Document Decisions

**Every significant decision should be logged:**

```markdown
## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs | Decided By | Related AC |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| {{date}} | [What decided] | [Why] | [What rejected] | {{your name}} | AC: 1 |
```

**What counts as a decision:**
- Choosing approach A over approach B
- Setting a specific direction or strategy
- Making trade-off choices
- Anything future collaborators need to understand "why"

---

### Step 6: Track Blockers

**If something prevents progress:**

```markdown
## Blockers & Issues

| # | Blocker | Raised By | Date | Urgency | Status |
|---|---------|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | [Description] | {{your name}} | {{date}} | High | Open |

**Blocker Details:**
- **Description:** [Full explanation]
- **Impact:** [What's affected]
- **Needs:** [What's required to resolve]
- **Assigned To:** [Who's resolving]
```

---

### Step 7: Update YOUR Whiteboard Section

**After updating workspace, update whiteboards:**

Location: `0-roundtable/whiteboards.md`

Find your expert section and update:

```markdown
## {{Your Icon}} {{Your Name}}'s Whiteboard

### Active Work
- **{{Workspace Title}}** - {{status emoji}} {{status}}
  - Workspace: [link](workspace/workspace-name.md)
  - Deliverable: [link](../documents/category/file.md)
  - Quick note: [One-line current status]
  - Next: [What's next]

### Completed This Month
- ‚úÖ {{Completed work}} - {{date}} - [Brief outcome]
```

**Status Emojis:**
- ‚ö™ Draft
- ‚úÖ Approved
- üîÑ InProgress
- üìã Review
- ‚úÖ Done

---

### Step 8: Add to Checklist (If Needed)

**If founder needs to take action:**

Location: `0-roundtable/{{founder-name}}-checklist.md`

Add to appropriate priority section:

```markdown
| ‚úì | Task | From | What to Do | Link/Notes | Added |
|---|------|------|------------|------------|-------|
| ‚òê | **{{Action needed}}** | {{Your name}} | [Clear instructions] | [Workspace link] | {{date}} |
```

**Only add to checklist if founder MUST do something** - don't clutter with FYI items.

---

## üé® Whiteboard Quick Reference

### Expert Activity At-A-Glance Table

**You should NOT update this table** - it's a high-level summary.  
**DO update your detailed whiteboard section below it.**

### Your Expert Whiteboard Section

**Location:** Find your section in `whiteboards.md`

**Update when:**
- ‚úÖ You start work on a new workspace
- ‚úÖ Status changes (Draft ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done)
- ‚úÖ Work is completed
- ‚úÖ Major progress or blockers occur

**Keep updated:**
- Active Work list
- Completed This Month list
- Handoffs section (what you're passing to others)

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid
