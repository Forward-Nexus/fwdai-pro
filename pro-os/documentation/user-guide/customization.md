    marketing: "notion"
    legal: "docx"          # For lawyers
```

---

## Context Loading Optimization

```yaml
context:
  auto_load:
    - "project/project-kb.md"
    - "project/mission.md"
    - "roundtable/whiteboards.md"
  
  load_on_demand:
    - "project/people.md"
    - "documents/**"
  
  cache_duration: "1 hour"
  
  # For token efficiency
  summarize_if_larger_than: "10KB"
```

---

## Custom Folder Structure

### Reorganize Folders

```yaml
paths:
  # Default structure
  workspace: "roundtable/workspace"
  documents: "documents"
  
  # Custom structure
  drafts: "work-in-progress"       # Instead of workspace
  finals: "deliverables"           # Instead of documents
  specs: "deliverables/specs"      # Custom subfolder
  pitches: "deliverables/investor" # Custom subfolder
```

**Update paths, FWD PRO adapts!**

---

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Codebases

```yaml
performance:
  # Limit files scanned
  scan_limit: 1000
  
  # Exclude patterns
  scan_exclude:
    - "node_modules/"
    - "build/"
    - "dist/"
    - ".next/"
    - "coverage/"
  
  # Cache expensive operations
  cache_file_analysis: true
  cache_duration: "6 hours"
  
  # Parallel processing

  max_workers: 4
```

---

## Team Customization

### Team-Specific Settings

## Advanced: Expert Modification

### Modify Core Expert Behavior

**‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced users only!**

**Location:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/experts/denny-systems-architect.md`

**Example: Add Custom Guidelines**

```markdown
## Custom Guidelines for This Project

### Our Specific Conventions
- Use Supabase RLS for all database access
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- All APIs must be versioned (/api/v1/)
- Use React Query for state management
- TypeScript strict mode always

### Our Tech Decisions
- Prefer serverless functions over long-running servers
- Use Expo managed workflow (not bare)
- Store files in Supabase Storage
- Use Stripe for payments

### Our Preferences
- Detailed specs (3-5 pages minimum)
- Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
- Always consider mobile-first
- Security review required for auth/payments
```

**Denny now follows your project's conventions!**

## Export/Import Configurations

### Export Your Configuration

```bash
# Export current config
cp .fwdpro/pro-os/config.yaml ~/my-fwdpro-config.yaml

# Export custom experts
cp .fwdpro/pro-os/experts/my-domain-expert.md ~/
```

### Import to New Project

```bash
# In new project, after install
cp ~/my-fwdpro-config.yaml .fwdpro/pro-os/config.yaml
cp ~/my-domain-expert.md .fwdpro/pro-os/experts/

# Update project
@update-onboarding
```

**Reuse your setup across projects!**

---

## Advanced Workflows

### Conditional Workflows

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "feature-development"
    trigger: "@create-feature"
    conditions:
      if: "work_type == 'building'"
      then: [denny, ada, elle]
      else: [genna]
  
  - name: "hotfix"
    trigger: "@fix critical"
    skip_review: true      # Emergency bypass
    experts: [ada]
    notify: [denny]
```

---

## Troubleshooting Customization

### Validate Configuration

```
@genna validate my configuration

‚Üí Checks config.yaml for errors
‚Üí Suggests improvements
```

### Reset to Defaults

```bash
# Backup your config
cp .fwdpro/pro-os/config.yaml ~/config-backup.yaml

# Reset to defaults
npx @fwdai/pro reset-config

# Restore if needed
cp ~/config-backup.yaml .fwdpro/pro-os/config.yaml
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Defaults

Don't customize until you understand the system!

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Use defaults
- Month 1: Minor tweaks
- Month 2+: Custom workflows

### 2. Document Your Changes

```yaml
# config.yaml

# CUSTOM: Changed for our team
communication_style: "d"  # We prefer direct

# CUSTOM: Added for client work
work_types:
  - "client_reporting"  # Added Dec 2024
```

### 3. Version Control Config

```bash
git add .fwdpro/pro-os/config.yaml
git commit -m "Custom FWD PRO config for our team"
```

### 4. Test Changes

After major config changes:

```
@rt-update

‚Üí Verify experts behave as expected
```

### 5. Share with Team

If team uses FWD PRO, document your customizations:

```markdown
# Our FWD PRO Setup

## Custom Work Types
- client_reporting: Benji + Lyna

## Custom Commands
- @weekly-review: Every Friday
- @client-update: Monthly reports

## Custom Experts
- Alex (Client Relations): For client-facing work
```
