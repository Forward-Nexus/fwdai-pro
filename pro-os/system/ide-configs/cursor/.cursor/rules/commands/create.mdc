# @create Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@create`

**This rule loads the universal creation command workflow**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/create.md`

This command provides a flexible workflow for creating anything - specs, designs, documents, content, strategies, briefs, etc. The AI infers structure based on context.

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at Post-Flight phase:**

**Always load:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/quality-checklist.md` (universal quality validation)

**Load based on what's being created:**
- Creating content/marketing? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/content-checklist.md`
- Creating code? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/code-checklist.md` + `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/code-style/`
- Creating technical spec? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/spec-standards.md` + `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/spec-checklist.md`
- Creating investor materials? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/investor-materials-standards.md`
- Legal/compliance work? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/legal-review-checklist.md`
- Making research claims? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md`
- Processing documents? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/document-processing-standards.md`

## Key Principles

- **Token Efficiency:** Check what's already in context before loading
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight (understand) → Execution (create) → Post-Flight (quality validation with checklist)
- **Adaptive Intelligence:** AI infers structure based on what's being created
- **Expert Integration:** Works with any expert based on domain needs
- **Quality Enforcement:** Appropriate checklist MUST be used in Post-Flight phase

## Alternative Commands

- For technical specs with TDD enforcement → use `@create-specflow`
- For updating existing items → use `@update`
