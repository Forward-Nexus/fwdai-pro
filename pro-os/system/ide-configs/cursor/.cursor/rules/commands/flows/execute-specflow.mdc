# @execute-specflow Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@execute-specflow`

**This rule loads the TDD-enforced implementation flow**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/flows/execute-specflow.md`

This flow command implements technical specifications with **mandatory TDD enforcement** and structured quality phases.

---

## When to Use This

✅ **Use `@execute-specflow` when:**
- Implementing from a technical spec
- Want TDD enforced (tests pass before shipping)
- Need bulletproof implementation quality
- Building features (not content/strategy)

❌ **Use `@execute` instead when:**
- Flexible implementation needed
- Content or campaign execution
- No strict TDD requirements

---

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at Post-Flight phase:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/code-checklist.md` (REQUIRED - no exceptions)
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/code-style/` (all relevant style guides)

---

## Key Principles

- **TDD Enforcement:** All tests must pass before completion (non-negotiable)
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight → Execution → Post-Flight (MANDATORY QA phase)
- **Expert Integration:** Works best with Ada (or Denny for architecture)
- **Quality First:** `code-checklist.md` MUST be validated at end + all tests passing (no shipping without both)
