This command provides a structured quality review process for evaluating work - code, content, designs, strategies, or any deliverable requiring expert feedback.

---

## Load Quality Standards

**Load based on what's being reviewed:**
- Reviewing code? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/code-checklist.md`
- Reviewing content? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/content-checklist.md`
- Reviewing spec? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/spec-checklist.md`
- Reviewing legal docs? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/legal-review-checklist.md`
- General review? → `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/quality-checklist.md`

**If work has research claims:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md`

## Key Principles

- **Token Efficiency:** Check context before loading files
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight (understand criteria) → Execution (review using checklist) → Post-Flight (deliver actionable feedback)
- **Expert Lens:** Each expert reviews only through their domain expertise
- **Checklist-Driven:** Use appropriate checklist as review framework
- **Actionable Feedback:** Provide specific, concrete suggestions for improvement
