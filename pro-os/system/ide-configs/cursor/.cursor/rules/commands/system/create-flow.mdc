# @create-flow Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@create-flow`

**This rule loads the flow creation system command**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/system/create-flow.md`

This system command creates new flow commands with structured multi-step workflows and quality enforcement.

---

## What This Creates

When you use `@create-flow`, it generates:

1. **Flow Command Document** (`.md`)
   - Location: `pro-os/commands/flows/{name}-flow.md`
   - Contains: Structured 3-phase workflow with enforcement

2. **Flow Activation Rule** (`.mdc`)
   - Location: `.cursor/rules/commands/flows/{name}-flow.mdc`
   - Contains: Trigger and command loading

---

## Key Principles

- **Structured Workflows:** Three-phase enforcement (Pre-Flight → Execution → Post-Flight)
- **Quality Enforcement:** Mandatory checklists and standards
- **Pattern Integration:** Loads relevant patterns and standards
- **Use Cases:** For repeatable, quality-critical workflows
