# @plan Command Activation

**Trigger:** User mentions `@plan`

**This rule loads the planning command workflow**

---

## Load Command

**Read:** `.fwdpro/pro-os/commands/plan.md`

This command provides a structured approach for planning projects, features, campaigns, or any initiative requiring strategic thinking and roadmapping.

---

## Load Quality Standards

**MANDATORY - Load at Post-Flight phase:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/checklists/quality-checklist.md` (validate plan quality)

**If plan includes research/projections:**
- `.fwdpro/pro-os/system/standards/research-citation-standards.md` (cite sources for claims)

---

## Key Principles

- **Token Efficiency:** Check context before loading files
- **Three-Phase Workflow:** Pre-Flight (understand goals) → Execution (create plan) → Post-Flight (validate with checklist & refine)
- **Expert Integration:** Works with strategic experts (Genna, Denny for technical, Lyna for external, Benji for internal)
- **Actionable Output:** Plans include concrete next steps and success metrics
- **Quality Validation:** Plan must pass quality checklist (actionable, measurable, realistic)
