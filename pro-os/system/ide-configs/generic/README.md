# Generic IDE Setup

**You're using FWD PRO in generic mode - works in any AI coding tool!**

## How to Use

FWD PRO doesn't require any special IDE configuration. Just use natural language with your AI assistant:

### Tag Experts

```
@denny can you create a spec for authentication?

@lyna help me create a pitch deck for investors

@ada let's build the login feature

@genna what should our 5-year vision be?
```

### Use Commands

```
@denny @create spec for user authentication

@benji @analyze our marketing performance

@elle @review these terms of service
```

### Check Your Work

- **0-ROUNDTABLE.md** - See what experts are working on
- **0-[YOUR-NAME]-CHECKLIST.md** - Your action items

---

## Your AI Tool Should Read

Make sure your AI assistant can access:
- `pro-os/` folder (expert definitions and system)
- `0-ROUNDTABLE.md` (collaboration space)
- Your project files

Most AI coding tools automatically include workspace files - you're probably all set!
