### Example: Technical Blocker

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues

### Session Timeout Duration Decision

**Issue:** Cannot finalize authentication spec without session timeout decision.

**What was tried:**
1. **Researched industry standards** - Found wide range (7-90 days) depending on security needs and user convenience preferences. No single "correct" answer.
2. **Checked project KB** - No specific requirements documented for session management strategy.
3. **Reviewed similar apps** - Competitor analysis shows mixed approaches: banking apps use 7 days (high security), social apps use 30-90 days (convenience).

**What's needed:** Founder decision on security vs. convenience trade-off for this app's user base.

**Impact:**
- Blocks: Completing auth spec, starting Ada's implementation
- Timeline: 2-day delay if not decided by end of week
- Workaround: Can spec other auth features, but token refresh logic depends on this

**Recommendation:** 
Based on this being a recovery app with sensitive personal data, I recommend 30-day timeout as a balanced approach:
- **7 days** = High security but frequent re-logins (may frustrate users in vulnerable state)
- **30 days** = Industry standard, balances security with convenience
- **90 days** = Maximum convenience but increased security risk

**Urgency:** üü† High - Blocking auth spec completion

**Added:** 2025-10-06 by Denny
**Status:** Unresolved - Awaiting founder input

## Question Template (For Founder)

### In Founder Checklist

```markdown
### [Category] - [Priority Level]

- [ ] **[Question Title]** - [What you need to know/decide]
  - **From:** [Expert name]
  - **Context:** [Why this question matters and background]
  - **Options:** (if applicable)
    - **Option A:** [Description]
      - Pros: [Benefits]
      - Cons: [Drawbacks]
      - Cost/Time: [If relevant]
    - **Option B:** [Description]
      - Pros: [Benefits]
      - Cons: [Drawbacks]
      - Cost/Time: [If relevant]
  - **My recommendation:** [Expert's suggested choice with reasoning]
  - **Urgency:** [When decision is needed]
  - **Blocking:** [What can't proceed without this]
  - **Workspace:** [Link to workspace with full context]
  - **Date added:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Example: Decision Question

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority - This Week

- [ ] **Authentication session timeout duration** - How long should users stay logged in?
  - **From:** Denny
  - **Context:** Finalizing authentication spec. Need to balance security (shorter sessions) with user convenience (longer sessions). This determines how often users need to re-login.
  - **Options:**
    - **7 days (High Security)**
      - Pros: Better security, follows banking app standards
      - Cons: Users re-login weekly, could frustrate users in recovery
      - Best for: Apps with highly sensitive data
    - **30 days (Balanced) ‚≠ê**
      - Pros: Industry standard, good security-convenience balance
      - Cons: Slightly less secure than 7-day
      - Best for: Most consumer apps including ODAT
    - **90 days (Maximum Convenience)**
      - Pros: Users rarely need to re-login
      - Cons: Increased security risk if device stolen
      - Best for: Low-risk apps prioritizing convenience
  - **My recommendation:** 30 days - It's the industry standard and balances your users' needs for both security and convenience. Recovery app users may be in vulnerable states, so we don't want frequent login friction, but we also need to protect their sensitive data.
  - **Urgency:** Need decision by Friday to stay on schedule
  - **Blocking:** Can't complete auth spec or start implementation without this
  - **Workspace:** [roundtable/workspace/auth-feature.md](roundtable/workspace/auth-feature.md)
  - **Date added:** 2025-10-06
```

## Warning Template

### For Potential Issues

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: [Issue Title]

**What:** [Brief description of potential issue]

**Why it matters:** [Impact if not addressed]

**Timeline:** [When this should be addressed]

**Noted by:** [Expert] on [Date]
```

### Example: Technical Debt Warning

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Authentication Code Duplication

**What:** Auth validation logic is duplicated across 3 services (user, admin, api). Currently manageable but will become maintenance burden.

**Why it matters:** 
- Bug fixes need to be applied in 3 places
- Inconsistencies could create security gaps
- Harder to update auth logic in future

**Risk level:** üü° Medium - Not urgent but should address in next refactor

**Recommendation:** Extract to shared auth utility module in next sprint. Estimated 4 hours of work.

**Timeline:** Address in next refactoring sprint (not blocking current work)

**Noted by:** Ada on 2025-10-06
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Template

**Use Blocker Template when:**
- You've tried 3 approaches and still stuck
- Work literally cannot proceed
- You need founder decision or external input

**Use Question Template when:**
- Need founder input but not blocking
- Multiple valid options exist
- Strategic decision needed

**Use Warning Template when:**
- Potential future issue identified
- Technical debt created
- Risk assessment needed

**Use Clarification Request when:**
- Requirements unclear
- Ambiguity in spec
- Need more context

### Tips for Effective Issue Documentation

**Be specific:**
- "Need auth decision" ‚ùå
- "Need decision on 7-day vs 30-day session timeout" ‚úÖ

**Show your work:**
- "Can't figure out API integration" ‚ùå
- "Tried approach A (failed because X), B (failed because Y), C (failed because Z)" ‚úÖ

**Provide context:**
- "This is blocked" ‚ùå
- "This blocks auth spec completion, which blocks Ada's implementation, delaying launch by 2 days" ‚úÖ

**Offer solutions:**
- "What should I do?" ‚ùå
- "I recommend option B because [reasoning]. What do you think?" ‚úÖ

## Remember

**Good issue documentation:**
- Saves time (no back-and-forth for clarification)
- Shows professionalism (you've done your homework)
- Makes decisions easier (options are clear)
- Preserves context (future reference)

**Take the time to document well!**
