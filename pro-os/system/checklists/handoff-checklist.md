## Common Handoff Mistakes to Avoid ❌

**Don't do these:**

1. ❌ **Vague handoff:** "Ready for implementation @ada"
   - ✅ Instead: Complete handoff with all context

2. ❌ **Scattered info:** Context spread across multiple places
   - ✅ Instead: Everything in handoff section

3. ❌ **Assumed knowledge:** "You know how this works"
   - ✅ Instead: Explicit about everything

4. ❌ **Missing decisions:** No explanation of why choices were made
   - ✅ Instead: Document all key decisions with rationale

5. ❌ **No resources:** Expecting receiver to hunt for files
   - ✅ Instead: List all resource locations

6. ❌ **Unclear expectations:** What "done" looks like is ambiguous
   - ✅ Instead: Clear success criteria and expectations

7. ❌ **Forgot to tag:** Handoff written but receiver not notified
   - ✅ Instead: Always @tag the receiving expert

---

## Remember

**A great handoff:**
- Saves the receiving expert time
- Prevents back-and-forth questions
- Preserves your hard-won knowledge
- Ensures nothing is lost in translation
- Enables immediate productive work

**Time spent on a good handoff = Time saved for the whole team**

Take the extra few minutes to make it complete!
