## Before Marking Content Complete

### Audience & Purpose
- [ ] Target audience clearly defined
- [ ] Goal of content specified (awareness, conversion, engagement)
- [ ] Key message identified
- [ ] Desired action clear (what should audience do?)

### Brand & Voice
- [ ] Tone matches brand (authentic, vulnerable, professional, etc.)
- [ ] Voice is consistent throughout
- [ ] Language appropriate for audience
- [ ] Recovery-informed (if applicable to [PROJECT_NAME])

### Content Quality
- [ ] Opening hook captures attention
- [ ] Story arc is compelling (problem → solution → transformation)
- [ ] Emotional beats land effectively
- [ ] Call-to-action is clear and compelling
- [ ] Length appropriate for platform/medium

### Messaging
- [ ] Value proposition is clear
- [ ] Benefits emphasized over features
- [ ] Differentiation from competitors evident
- [ ] Proof points or credibility included
- [ ] Urgency or timeliness incorporated (if appropriate)

### Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Claims are factual and supportable
- [ ] Testimonials have proper attribution (if used)
- [ ] Disclaimers included where needed
- [ ] Elle has reviewed for legal issues (if makes claims)

### Research & Citation Integrity
- [ ] **Statistics verified** - Web search performed for any stats/benchmarks
- [ ] **Sources cited** - Real sources with URLs (not LLM training memory)
- [ ] **Claims backed up** - "Studies show..." has actual study reference
- [ ] **Estimates marked** - Projections clearly marked as projections
- [ ] **No fake research** - Never cite research you didn't verify

**Reference:** See `system/standards/research-citation-standards.md` for content-specific verification.

### AI Language Audit (Required for Investor-Facing & External Content)

**Purpose:** Detect and eliminate repetitive AI-generated phrases that make content feel robotic.

**Search for repetitive phrases (3+ occurrences in document):**
- [ ] "Key insight:" → Replace with direct statement or vary language
- [ ] "Why this matters:" → Remove or rephrase contextually
- [ ] "It's worth noting that..." → Direct statement instead
- [ ] "Importantly," / "Notably," → Use sparingly, vary placement
- [ ] "✅ ALIGNED" (or similar markers) → If used 3+ times, vary language
- [ ] Templated section headers → Vary if repeated pattern detected
- [ ] "robust" / "seamless" / "cutting-edge" / "leverage" → Remove marketing filler
- [ ] "deep dive" / "level up" / "game-changer" → Overused tech clichés

**Structural pattern check:**
- [ ] Competitor descriptions → Vary structure (not "Company X does Y. Our advantage: Z" repeated)
- [ ] Feature descriptions → Avoid template-like repetition
- [ ] Section introductions → Check for formulaic openings

**Read aloud test:**
- [ ] Read document aloud (or imagine reading to investor)
- [ ] Flag any phrase that sounds like AI wrote it
- [ ] Remove phrases a real person wouldn't say in conversation
- [ ] Check if explanations sound natural or robotic

**Human authenticity check:**
- [ ] Would a real person say this to an investor over coffee?
- [ ] Does personality come through, or is it generic?
- [ ] Are there specific details vs. vague generalizations?

**Why this matters:** Investors and partners read hundreds of documents. AI-generated patterns are immediately recognizable and reduce credibility. Human-sounding writing builds trust.

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Character count within limits (if applicable)
- [ ] Format appropriate for platform
- [ ] Visual elements noted (images, videos needed)
- [ ] SEO keywords incorporated (if applicable)
- [ ] Links included where needed

### Testing & Optimization
- [ ] A/B testing opportunities identified
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Feedback mechanism in place
- [ ] Iteration plan outlined
