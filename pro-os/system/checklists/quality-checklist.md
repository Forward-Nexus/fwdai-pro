# Quality Checklist

Use this checklist before marking any work complete.

**Related patterns:**
- `pro-os/system/patterns/universal.md` - Universal command workflow (all commands follow three-phase pattern)
- `pro-os/system/patterns/spec.md` - For technical specs
- `pro-os/system/patterns/workspace.md` - For workspace structures

## Before Marking Complete

Ask yourself:

- Is this the level of quality I'd want to receive?
- Have I done my best work here?
- Is there anything I'm cutting corners on?

If any answer is "no" or "maybe" - make it better before marking complete.
