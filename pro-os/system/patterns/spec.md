# FWD PRO Spec Pattern
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Reusable structure for comprehensive technical specifications with TDD enforcement

---

## Overview

This is the **ONE comprehensive spec file** pattern used by FWD PRO flow commands like `@create-specflow`.

### Key Principles

1. **ONE file has EVERYTHING** - No fragmentation across multiple files
2. **TDD Structure** - Every task: test first → implement → verify last
3. **Story-Driven** - Human context (why) + AI execution (how)
4. **Progressive Detail** - High-level story → detailed tasks
5. **QA Mandatory** - Can't skip quality phase
6. **NO dates in folder names** - Dates go in metadata only

---

## File Location Pattern

```
documents/tech/specs/[feature-name]/
  └── spec.md              ← ONE comprehensive file
```

**Examples:**
- `documents/tech/specs/user-authentication/spec.md`
- `documents/tech/specs/therapist-summary-fix/spec.md`
- `documents/tech/specs/payment-processing/spec.md`

**❌ DON'T:**
- `documents/tech/specs/2025-10-09-user-auth/` ← NO dates in folder names
- `documents/tech/specs/user-auth/spec.md` + `tasks.md` + `decisions.md` ← NO multiple files
- `documents/tech/specs/user-auth-v2.md` ← NO version suffixes (update original)

---

## The Spec Structure

### Complete Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Technical Specification

## Metadata

```yaml
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
owner: @[expert-name]
status: draft | in-progress | review | complete
priority: low | medium | high | critical
workspace: documents/tech/workspaces/[workspace-name]/
type: feature | bugfix | enhancement | infrastructure
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
```

---

## Story

**As a** [role/user type]  
**I want** [capability/feature]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Alternative Format (Problem/Solution):**
- **Problem:** [What problem are we solving?]
- **Solution:** [What are we building?]
- **Benefit:** [Why does this matter?]

**Context & Background:**
[Additional context about why this matters, how it fits larger project goals, any relevant history]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

What "done" looks like (specific, testable, verifiable):

1. [ ] [Criterion 1 - clear and measurable]
2. [ ] [Criterion 2 - clear and measurable]
3. [ ] [Criterion 3 - clear and measurable]
4. [ ] [Criterion 4 - clear and measurable]

**How to write good AC:**
- Be specific and testable
- Use "When X, then Y" or "Given A, should B" format
- Focus on outcomes, not implementation
- Should be verifiable by someone other than implementer

---

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
[High-level architecture, components involved, data flow]

### System Components
- **Component 1:** [Purpose, responsibilities]
- **Component 2:** [Purpose, responsibilities]
- **Component 3:** [Purpose, responsibilities]

### Data Model
[Database schema changes, new tables, field modifications]

```yaml
# Example
table: users
fields:
  - name: email_verified
    type: boolean
    default: false
  - name: verification_token
    type: string
    nullable: true
```

### API Design
[Endpoints, request/response formats, authentication]

```yaml
# Example
endpoint: POST /api/auth/verify-email
authentication: required
request:
  verification_token: string
response:
  success: boolean
  message: string
```

### Security Considerations
- [Security requirement 1]
- [Security requirement 2]
- [Authentication/authorization approach]

### Performance Considerations
- [Performance requirement 1]
- [Scalability considerations]
- [Caching strategy if applicable]

### Integration Points
- [External service 1] - [How integrated]
- [Internal system 2] - [How integrated]

## Implementation Tasks

> **TDD STRUCTURE:** Every task follows Test → Implement → Verify pattern

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

- [ ] **1.1 Write Tests for [Feature Component]** ← ALWAYS FIRST
  - **AC:** [1, 2]
  - **Tests to Create:**
    - `tests/[feature]/[component].test.js`
    - Test case 1: [Description]
    - Test case 2: [Description]

## Completion Checklist

Before marking this spec as COMPLETE:

- [ ] Story is clear and user-focused
- [ ] All AC are specific and testable
- [ ] Every task follows TDD pattern (test → implement → verify)
- [ ] QA phase is included and detailed
- [ ] Technical design is documented
- [ ] All decisions are explained with rationale
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Progress log maintained
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code quality standards met
- [ ] Workspace linked and updated
- [ ] Location follows pattern: `documents/tech/specs/[feature-name]/spec.md`

---

**Last Updated:** [Date] by [Expert]
```

---

## Usage by Commands

### `@create-specflow` uses this pattern to:
1. Create the folder structure
2. Generate spec.md with all sections
3. Fill in Story, AC, Technical Design from requirements
4. Create TDD-structured tasks
5. Include mandatory QA phase

### `@execute-specflow` uses this pattern to:
1. Read the spec
2. Follow task order (TDD structure)
3. Update Progress Log as work happens
4. Mark AC as complete
5. Execute QA phase (can't skip)

---

## TDD Task Structure Rules

**Every implementation task MUST follow this pattern:**

```markdown
- [ ] X.1 Write tests ← FIRST
  - Tests to create
  - Coverage goal
  - Expected: FAIL (red)

- [ ] X.2 Implement feature
  - Files to create/modify
  - Implementation notes
  - Expected: PASS (green)

- [ ] X.3 Verify tests pass ← LAST
  - Run tests
  - Check coverage
  - No regressions
```

**Why this structure:**
- ✅ Enforces TDD (can't implement without tests)
- ✅ Clear expectations (red → green)
- ✅ Built-in verification step
- ✅ Prevents "I'll write tests later"

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Make Story and AC clear before creating tasks
- Break work into phases (manageable chunks)
- Document decisions as you make them
- Update progress log in real-time
- Include QA phase (mandatory)
- Link to workspace for collaboration context
- Keep one spec per feature (consolidate)
- Update existing spec, don't create v2

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't skip TDD structure (required)
- Don't omit QA phase (mandatory)
- Don't put dates in folder names
- Don't create multiple files (one spec has everything)
- Don't write implementation tasks without tests
- Don't mark complete without QA
- Don't create duplicate specs

---

## Integration with Workspace

**Relationship:**
- **Spec** = Source of truth (detailed, technical, TDD structure)
- **Workspace** = Collaboration hub (progress summaries, handoffs, expert notes)

**Workflow:**
1. Create spec (this pattern)
2. Create workspace (links to spec)
3. Work happens (update both)
4. Progress log (detailed in spec)
5. Progress summary (high-level in workspace)
6. Handoffs (in workspace with context)

**Workspace references spec:**
```markdown
**Deliverable:** [Spec](../../documents/tech/specs/feature-name/spec.md)
```

**Spec references workspace:**
```yaml
workspace: documents/tech/workspaces/feature-name/
```

---

## Quality Standards

### Spec Quality Checklist

Run `pro-os/system/checklists/spec-checklist.md` before marking complete.

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Story clear and user-focused
- [ ] AC specific and testable
- [ ] TDD structure in all tasks
- [ ] QA phase detailed
- [ ] Technical design complete
- [ ] Decisions documented
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Progress tracking in place

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature Spec

**Feature:** Password Reset

**Folder:** `documents/tech/specs/password-reset/spec.md`

**Story:** "As a user, I want to reset my password via email, so that I can regain access if I forget it."

**AC:**
1. User can request password reset via email
2. Reset link expires after 1 hour
3. Password meets security requirements

**Tasks follow TDD pattern** for email sending, token generation, password update.

### Example 2: Complex Feature Spec

**Feature:** Real-time Chat System

**Folder:** `documents/tech/specs/realtime-chat/spec.md`

**Story:** "As a user, I want to chat in real-time with my therapist, so that we can communicate between sessions."

**AC:**
1. Messages deliver instantly (< 1s)
2. Messages persist and sync across devices
3. Typing indicators show activity
4. Offline messages queue and send when online

**Tasks span multiple phases** (backend WebSocket, frontend UI, message persistence) - all with TDD structure.

---

## Adaptation Notes

**For Non-Code Specs:**

If creating specs for non-code work (infrastructure, processes, content), adapt the pattern:

- Keep Story, AC, Tasks, Decisions, Progress Log
- Replace "Technical Design" with "Approach/Strategy"
- Replace "TDD structure" with "Draft → Review → Finalize" pattern
- Replace "Tests" with "Validation Criteria"
- Keep QA phase (quality review)

**Example:** Infrastructure deployment spec, operational process spec, content creation spec.

---
