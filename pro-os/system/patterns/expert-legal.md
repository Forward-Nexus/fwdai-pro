## Legal & Compliance Workflow

### Phase 1: Legal Context & Research

#### Step 1: Understand Legal Context

**Load relevant project context:**
- `project/project-kb.md` - Industry, stage, constraints
- `project/mission.md` - What the company does
- `project/founder-profile.md` - Founder's risk tolerance

**Identify key legal factors:**
- What industry? (determines regulations)
- What stage? (determines legal priorities)
- What jurisdiction? (determines applicable law)
- What data handling? (determines privacy requirements)
- What claims being made? (determines liability)

**Check for existing legal requirements:**
```markdown
Common constraints in project-kb.md:
- HIPAA (healthcare)
- GDPR (EU users)
- PCI DSS (payments)
- SOC 2 (enterprise)
- Industry-specific regulations
```

#### Step 2: Research Current Legal Standards

**CRITICAL: Always check current year and regulations!**

```markdown
Search patterns:
- "[regulation] requirements [current year]"
- "[industry] compliance checklist [current year]"
- "[jurisdiction] [law] updates [current year]"
- "[topic] legal best practices [current year]"
```

**Examples:**
- "GDPR compliance requirements 2025"
- "HIPAA regulations updates 2025"
- "California privacy law CCPA 2025"
- "SaaS terms of service best practices 2025"

**Why this matters:**
- Laws change frequently
- New regulations emerge
- Enforcement priorities shift
- Legal precedents evolve
- Best practices update

#### Step 3: Identify Applicable Laws & Regulations

**Create compliance checklist:**

**Privacy & Data Protection:**
- [ ] GDPR (EU users)
- [ ] CCPA/CPRA (California users)
- [ ] Other state privacy laws
- [ ] International data transfer rules
- [ ] Data breach notification laws

**Industry-Specific:**
- [ ] HIPAA (healthcare)
- [ ] FERPA (education)
- [ ] GLBA (financial)
- [ ] FDA (medical devices/pharma)
- [ ] FCC (telecom)
- [ ] Industry-specific regulations

### Phase 2: Legal Review & Analysis

#### Step 1: Legal Risk Assessment

**For any work being reviewed, assess:**

**Legal Risk Framework:**

1. **Identify Potential Issues:**
   - What could go wrong legally?
   - What claims are being made?
   - What promises are implied?
   - What liabilities exist?
   - What regulations apply?

2. **Assess Severity:**
   - üî¥ **HIGH RISK:** Could result in lawsuits, fines, shutdown
   - üü° **MEDIUM RISK:** Could result in warnings, minor penalties
   - üü¢ **LOW RISK:** Minor issues, easy to fix

3. **Evaluate Likelihood:**
   - **High:** Very likely to cause problems
   - **Medium:** Could cause problems
   - **Low:** Unlikely to cause problems

4. **Recommend Action:**
   - **MUST FIX:** High risk, must address before launch
   - **SHOULD FIX:** Medium risk, fix soon
   - **NICE TO FIX:** Low risk, fix when possible
   - **ACCEPTABLE:** Risk is acceptable with disclosure

#### Step 2: Compliance Verification

**For compliance reviews:**

**Compliance Checklist Process:**

1. **Identify Requirements:**
   - What laws/regulations apply?
   - What are the specific requirements?
   - What are the penalties for non-compliance?

2. **Assess Current State:**
   - Are we compliant? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
   - What's missing?
   - What needs updating?
   - What's the gap?

3. **Document Findings:**
   ```markdown
   ## Compliance Review: [Regulation Name]
   
   **Status:** ‚úÖ Compliant / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Non-Compliant
   
   ### Requirements:

3. **Risk Factors:**

   - [ ] Non-compete too broad (NEGOTIATE)
   - [ ] Auto-renewal unfavorable (REVIEW)

4. **Recommendations:**
   ```markdown
   ## Contract Review: [Contract Name]
   
   **Overall Assessment:** ‚úÖ Acceptable / ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Changes / ‚ùå Don't Sign
   
   ### Red Flags (MUST address):

   - ‚ùå Medical/health claims (highly regulated)
   - ‚ùå Financial advice (requires licensing)
   - ‚ùå Testimonials without disclosure

4. **Recommend Changes:**
   ```markdown
