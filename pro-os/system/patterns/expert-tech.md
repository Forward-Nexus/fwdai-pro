## Technical Workflow

### Phase 1: Technical Design (Denny's Domain)

**If you're designing a technical spec:**

#### Step 1: Understand Requirements

**Gather context:**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who's the user/audience?
- What are the constraints? (time, budget, tech stack, compliance)
- What are the acceptance criteria?

**Ask smart questions:**
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "Any specific technical requirements?"
- "Performance/security/compliance needs?"
- "Integration with existing systems?"

**Don't ask if you can infer from context!**

#### Step 2: Research Current Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Always check current year and best practices!**

```markdown
Search patterns:
- "[technology] best practices [current year]"
- "[framework] architecture patterns [current year]"
- "[problem] solutions [current year]"
- "security considerations [technology] [current year]"
```

**Examples:**
- "React state management best practices 2025"
- "Node.js API design patterns 2025"
- "PostgreSQL schema design best practices 2025"

**Why this matters:**
- Technology evolves rapidly
- Best practices change
- New security vulnerabilities discovered
- Better patterns emerge

#### Step 3: Design the System

**Create technical specification with:**

1. **Overview**
   - What we're building
   - Why we're building it
   - High-level approach

2. **Architecture**
   - System components
   - Data flow
   - Integration points
   - Technology choices (with rationale)

3. **Technical Details**
   - API endpoints/interfaces
   - Database schema
   - Key algorithms/logic
   - Error handling approach

4. **Implementation Guide**
   - Step-by-step implementation tasks
   - In priority order
   - Each task testable
   - Clear acceptance criteria

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - What needs testing
   - How to test it
   - Test scenarios/edge cases

6. **Security & Compliance**
   - Security considerations
   - Compliance requirements
   - Data privacy needs

7. **Open Questions**
   - Decisions needed from founder
   - Trade-offs to consider
   - Alternatives evaluated

**Use the spec pattern:** `system/patterns/spec.md` for detailed structure

#### Step 4: Document in Workspace

**In your workspace section:**
```markdown
## Denny's Design

**Status:** [Draft/Review/Approved]

### Design Approach:
[High-level explanation]

### Key Decisions:
- **[Decision]:** [Rationale]
- **[Technology choice]:** [Why this vs alternatives]

### Trade-offs:
- **[Trade-off]:** [Pros/cons, recommendation]

### Research:
- [Link to best practices found]
- [Link to similar implementations]

### Questions for Founder:
- [Any decisions needed]

### Handoff to @ada:
[Everything Ada needs to implement this]
```

#### Step 5: Create Deliverable

**Save spec in:** `documents/tech/`

**Spec file includes:**
- Complete technical specification
- Implementation task breakdown (TDD format if using @create-specflow)
- Testing requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Clean, polished, ready for implementation

---

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation (Ada's Domain)

**If you're implementing technical work:**

#### Step 1: Load Spec Context

**Read the spec thoroughly:**
- Understand the design
- Review architecture decisions
- Note testing requirements
- Check for handoff notes from Denny

**If anything is unclear:**
- Ask in workspace (tag @denny)
- Don't guess or make assumptions
- Better to clarify than implement wrong

#### Step 2: Set Up TDD (Test-Driven Development)

**THE RULE: Tests FIRST, then code!**

**For each implementation task:**

1. **Write the test FIRST**
   ```markdown
   - Write failing test that defines expected behavior
   - Test should be specific and testable
   - Include edge cases and error scenarios
   ```

2. **Write minimal code to pass test**
   ```markdown
   - Implement just enough to pass the test
   - Don't over-engineer
   - Keep it simple
   ```

3. **Refactor if needed**
   ```markdown
   - Clean up code
   - Improve readability
   - Optimize if necessary
   ```

4. **Verify all tests pass**
   ```markdown
   - Run full test suite
   - Ensure no regressions
   - All tests green before moving on
   ```

**Why TDD matters:**
- Catches bugs early
- Ensures testable code
- Documents expected behavior
- Prevents regressions
- Forces clear thinking

#### Step 3: Implement According to Spec

**Follow the spec closely:**
- Implement tasks in order
- Check off each task as completed
- Update workspace with progress
- Log any deviations with rationale

**Best practices:**
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow project style guide
- Comment complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider edge cases
- Think about security

**Search current best practices:**
- Check latest patterns for the technology
- Review security considerations
- Look for common pitfalls
- Find optimization opportunities

#### Step 4: Test Thoroughly

**Testing requirements:**
- âœ… Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
- âœ… Integration tests (critical paths)
- âœ… Edge cases covered
- âœ… Error handling tested
- âœ… Security scenarios tested

**Run tests continuously:**
- After each change
- Before marking task complete
- Before handoff or deployment

**Document test coverage:**
- What's tested
- What's not (with rationale)
- Known limitations

#### Step 5: Document Implementation

**Update workspace with:**
```markdown
## Ada's Implementation

**Status:** [InProgress/Review/Complete]
**Test Coverage:** [X%]

### Completed:
- [Date] âœ… Task 1 - Tests passing
- [Date] âœ… Task 2 - Tests passing

### In Progress:
- [Date] ðŸ”„ Task 3 - Writing tests

### Decisions Made:
- **[Implementation detail]:** [Why I chose this approach]

### Deviations from Spec:
- **[What changed]:** [Why and benefits]

### Tests:
- Unit tests: [X passing]
- Integration tests: [Y passing]
- Coverage: [Z%]

### Ready for Review:
[Tag @denny when ready for QA]
```

#### Step 6: Quality Assurance

**Before marking complete, verify:**

âœ… **Code Quality:**
- All tests pass (100% green)
- 80%+ code coverage
- No linter errors
- Code reviewed (self or peer)
- Follows style guide

âœ… **Functionality:**
