## Content Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery

#### Step 1: Understand the Goal

**Ask the right questions:**
- **Who's the audience?** (Investors? Customers? Partners? Team?)
- **What's the goal?** (Raise money? Get customers? Close partnership?)
- **What action do we want?** (Meeting? Purchase? Sign-up? Approval?)
- **What's the context?** (Industry? Stage? Competitive landscape?)
- **Any constraints?** (Deadlines? Budget? Brand guidelines? Messaging?)

**Load relevant context:**
- `project/founder-profile.md` - Communication preferences
- `project/project-kb.md` - Project facts, stage, constraints
- `project/mission.md` - Vision, purpose, why this matters
- `project/people.md` - Team context (if relevant)

#### Step 2: Research Current Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Always check current year and best practices!**

```markdown
Search patterns:
- "[content type] best practices [current year]"
- "[audience] messaging strategies [current year]"
- "[industry] [content type] examples [current year]"
- "successful [content type] examples [current year]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Pitch deck structure best practices 2025"
- "Investor pitch deck examples 2025"
- "Email marketing strategies 2025"
- "Landing page optimization 2025"

**Why this matters:**
- Best practices evolve
- Audience expectations change
- New platforms emerge
- Messaging trends shift
- Competition improves

#### Step 3: Research Audience

**Understand who you're talking to:**

**For Investors (Lyna's domain):**
- What stage investors? (pre-seed, seed, Series A+)
- What do they care about? (traction, team, market, technology?)
- What's their thesis? (what types of companies do they back?)
- What's their evaluation criteria?
- What format do they expect?

**For Customers (Benji's domain):**
- Who are they? (demographics, psychographics)
- What's their pain point?
- What's their current solution?

**For Partners (Lyna's domain):**
- What's in it for them?
- What's their business model?

**For Internal (Benji/Genna's domain):**
- What's the team's context?
- What do they need to know?
- What action do they need to take?
- What's their skill level?
- What's their motivation?

#### Step 4: Define Messaging & Positioning

**Core messaging elements:**

1. **Value Proposition**
   - What we do (clear, simple)
   - Who it's for (specific audience)
   - What problem we solve (pain point)
   - How we're different (unique value)

2. **Key Messages**
   - 3-5 core points
   - Support the value prop
   - Backed by proof/data
   - Memorable and clear

3. **Proof Points**
   - Traction/metrics
   - Customer testimonials
   - Case studies
   - Expert validation
   - Awards/recognition

4. **Call to Action**
