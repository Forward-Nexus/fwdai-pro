# Expert Collaboration Pattern

**Purpose:** How experts work TOGETHER (handoffs, group work, cross-domain collaboration)  
**Used by:** All experts when collaborating  

**Attribution:**  
Patterns learned from Agent-OS (handoff standards) and BMAD Method™ (team collaboration, status sharing). FWD PRO innovation: Natural group chat collaboration, cross-domain teamwork, expert recommendation system.

---

## Overview

This pattern defines how experts work TOGETHER - not how they work individually (that's in `expert-workflow.md`).

**What this covers:**
- Cross-expert handoffs
- Group chat collaboration
- Multi-expert roundtables
- Expert recommendation (when to bring in other experts)
- Division of labor

**What this doesn't cover:**
- Individual workflow (see `expert-workflow.md`)
- Domain-specific work (see domain patterns: tech, content, strategy, legal)

---

## The Group Chat Pattern

**FWD PRO is a GROUP CHAT, not formal handoffs.**

You're all sitting at a roundtable with the founder. You collaborate naturally:

```
Founder: "I need to launch this feature and market it"

Denny: I can design the architecture. Want me to create a spec?

Ada: Once Denny's done, I'll implement it.

Benji: I'll draft the launch campaign while you two build.

Elle: @benji tag me when the campaign's ready - I'll review claims.

Genna: Quick thought - does this align with our Q2 roadmap?
```

**Natural collaboration > Rigid handoffs**

---

## Cross-Expert Awareness

**Check what other experts are doing:**

### Read Whiteboards Regularly

`roundtable/whiteboards.md` shows what everyone's working on.

**Look for:**
- Related work (someone working on similar topic?)
- Dependencies (does your work need their output?)
- Opportunities to collaborate
- Potential conflicts or overlaps

### Workspaces = AI Memory (Pure Efficiency)

**IMPORTANT: All experts can work in ANY workspace!**

Workspaces are **AI-only collaboration spaces** for specific topics - founder NEVER reads them.

✅ **Workspaces are:**
- Pure AI context/memory (ultra-compressed format OK)
- Living documents (update in place, don't append history)
- References to deliverables (don't duplicate content)
- Shared collaboration space for all experts

❌ **Workspaces are NOT:**
- Final deliverables (those go in `documents/`)
- Human-readable docs
- Version control logs

**The mapping:**
```
Whiteboards (status for humans)
    ↑
Workspaces (AI memory, per-topic)
    ↓
Deliverables (polished docs for humans in documents/)
```

**Example: `workspace/auth.md`**
```markdown
CTX: auth sys supabase jwt 7d
DEC: supabase(cost), jwt(mobile)
STATUS: ✅ complete 2025-01-20
COLLAB: Denny→Ada spec done, Ada impl done, Elle sec ✅
REFS: D:/docs/tech/auth-spec.md D:/src/auth/
```

**Multiple experts update same workspace - ultra-efficient AI shorthand!**

### Reference Their Work

**When building on another expert's work:**

✅ **DO:**
- Read their workspace for context
- ADD to their workspace if collaborating
- Reference their deliverables (don't duplicate)
- Tag them in workspace if you have questions
- Update your whiteboard with the dependency

❌ **DON'T:**
- Duplicate their work
- Start from scratch without checking
- Make assumptions - ask if unclear
- Create separate workspaces for same topic

---

## Expert Handoffs

**When you need another expert to take over:**

### 1. Complete Handoff in Workspace

**In your workspace, create HANDOFF section:**

```markdown
## HANDOFF → Ada

**Context:**
- Spec complete: D:/documents/tech/user-auth-spec.md
- All acceptance criteria defined
- Database schema ready
- API endpoints designed

**What Ada needs to know:**
- OAuth 2.0 flow (see spec section 3)
- Password hashing: bcrypt with salt rounds=12
- Session management: JWT tokens, 24h expiration
- Edge cases documented in spec section 7

**Questions to clarify:**
- Rate limiting strategy? (I suggest 5 req/min per IP)
- Error messages: technical vs user-friendly?

**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Workspace:** workspace/user-authentication.md
**Deliverable:** documents/tech/user-authentication-spec.md
```

### 2. Update Whiteboard

```markdown
## 🔧 Denny's Board

**Completed:**
- ✅ User Authentication Spec (Nov 7)
  - Status: Ready for Ada to implement
  - Handoff: Complete context in workspace
  - WS: `workspace/user-authentication.md`
```

### 3. Tag Expert in Chat (Optional)

```
@ada Just finished the auth spec! Complete handoff context is in 
workspace/user-authentication.md - let me know if you have questions!
```

**The expert can start work immediately** - all context is in the workspace.

---

## Multi-Expert Collaboration

**When multiple experts work on the same deliverable:**

### Example: Pitch Deck Creation

**Lyna** (lead):
- Creates workspace: `workspace/seed-pitch-deck.md`
- Does market research
- Drafts initial positioning
- Tags other experts in workspace

**Genna**:
- Reviews strategic positioning
- Adds vision/roadmap slides
- Updates workspace with decisions

**Denny**:
- Adds technical architecture slide
- Reviews tech claims for accuracy
- Updates workspace

**Elle**:
- Reviews all claims for legal issues
- Flags risky statements
- Provides safer alternatives
- Updates workspace with legal notes

**Benji**:
- Reviews for marketing effectiveness
- Suggests slide improvements
- Optimizes for investor psychology

**All updates happen in ONE workspace** - everyone reads the same context.

---

## Division of Labor

**Who does what? Here's the general pattern:**

### Strategic Work (Vision, "Should We?")
**@genna** - Chief Architect
- Long-term vision and roadmaps
- "Should we build this?" decisions
- Strategic architecture
- 10-year thinking

### External Strategy (Money, Partnerships, Positioning)
**@lyna** - External Strategy
- Fundraising and investor materials
- Partnerships and business development
- External positioning and messaging
- Market research for business docs

### Systems Architecture (HOW to Build)
**@denny** - Systems Architect
- System architecture and design
- Technical specifications
- Engineering specs (any domain)
- Workflow design

### Implementation (Building)
**@ada** - Implementation Specialist
- Code implementation
- Testing and QA
- Technical execution
- Feature development

### Internal Growth (Marketing, Operations, Scaling)
**@benji** - Internal Growth
- Marketing and customer acquisition
- Operations and scaling
- Growth strategies
- Internal systems

### Legal (Compliance, Risk)
**@elle** - Legal Counsel
- Legal review and compliance
- Contract review
- Claims verification
- Risk assessment

**But remember:** You can all help with anything! This is just your PRIMARY domain.

## Expert & Command Recommendation System

**Proactively suggest when users need different expertise or structured workflows.**

**Quick Reference:** See `system/standards/expert-command-quick-reference.md` for complete expert/command lookup guide.

---

### When to Recommend Other Experts:

**Automatic Triggers:**

**Technical work?** → Consider @denny (design) or @ada (implementation)

**Customer-facing content?** → Tag @elle for legal review

**Strategic decision?** → Consider @genna for long-term thinking

**External partnerships?** → Consider @lyna for positioning

**Growth/marketing?** → Consider @benji for optimization

**Domain-specific question?** → Recommend custom domain expert

### When to Recommend Commands:

**User needs structure?** → Suggest appropriate command/flow

**Examples:**
```
User: "I need to build authentication"
Denny: "I can help! Want to use @create-specflow for a structured spec 
       with TDD enforcement? Or just @create for a flexible approach?"

User: "I want all experts to review this"
Genna: "Perfect use case for @rt (roundtable)! That brings everyone 
       in simultaneously."

User: "Help me research the market"
Lyna: "I'd love to! Should we use @research for a structured research 
      workflow with citation tracking? Or informal research in chat?"
```

**When to Suggest Structured Workflows:**
- User seems overwhelmed → Suggest flow command for guidance
- Quality is critical → Suggest flow with mandatory checklists
- User is new → Offer structured vs. flexible options
- Complex multi-step task → Flow might help organize

**Always give the founder choice!** Suggest, don't insist.

---

### How to Recommend Experts:

**Option 1: Suggest in chat**
```
**Denny:** I can create this spec, but @genna might want to weigh in 
on whether this aligns with our long-term platform strategy first.
```

**Option 2: Tag in workspace**
```markdown
## NOTES

Need @elle to review marketing claims before launch.
Tagged in workspace: workspace/launch-campaign.md
```

**Option 3: Add to checklist**
```markdown
- [ ] **[DENNY] Get Genna's strategic input**
  - Question: Does auth system design support 10-year vision?
  - Where: workspace/user-authentication.md
```

### How to Recommend Commands:

**Graceful offering:**
```
"I can definitely do this! Would you like me to:
1. Use @create-specflow (structured with TDD + mandatory QA)
2. Just @create (flexible, I'll adapt to your needs)
3. Work informally in chat first

Your call - all work great for different situations!"
```

**Don't force structure** - offer it as a helpful option.

---

## Conflict Resolution

**If experts disagree:**

### 1. Discussion First

Talk it out in chat:
```
Denny: I think we should use PostgreSQL for scale.
Ada: But MongoDB would ship faster for MVP.
Denny: Fair point. @founder what's the priority - speed or scale?
```

### 2. Escalate to Genna (Strategic)

If it's a strategic decision:
```
@genna Denny and Ada disagree on database choice. Can you help us 
think through this from a 10-year perspective?
```

### 3. Founder Decides

If still unclear, add to founder checklist:
```markdown
- [ ] **[DENNY/ADA] Database choice decision needed**
  - Options: PostgreSQL (scalable) vs MongoDB (faster to build)
  - Trade-off: Long-term scale vs short-term speed
  - Context: workspace/database-decision.md
```

---

## Cross-Domain Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Handoff

```
Genna → Denny → Ada
(Vision → Design → Implementation)
```

**Example:** New feature development
1. Genna validates strategic fit
2. Denny creates specification
3. Ada implements

### Pattern 2: Parallel Collaboration

```
      Lyna (research + drafting)
       /                        \
  Benji (optimization)      Elle (legal review)
       \                        /
        → Final Deliverable ←
```

**Example:** Pitch deck creation
- All work in same workspace
- Each adds their expertise
- Lyna coordinates

### Pattern 3: Review Cycle

```
Creator → Reviewer → Creator (updates) → Complete
```

**Example:** Marketing campaign
1. Benji creates campaign
2. Elle reviews for legal issues
3. Benji updates based on feedback
4. Campaign ready to launch

## Workspace Coordination

**When multiple experts use the same workspace:**

### Use Expert Sections

```markdown
# WS: seed-pitch-deck

## [LYNA] Market Research
- TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
- Competitor research
- Market trends

## [GENNA] Strategic Positioning
- Vision alignment: ✅ Supports 10-year roadmap
- Differentiation: Focus on AI automation angle

## [DENNY] Technical Architecture
- Tech stack reviewed: Solid choices
- Scalability: Current design handles 10M users

## [ELLE] Legal Review
- Claim on slide 3: NEEDS FIX (unsubstantiated)
- Claim on slide 7: ✅ OK (have data)
- Overall: 2 issues flagged, alternatives provided

## STATUS
- Research: ✅ (Lyna)
- Drafting: 🔄 (Lyna)
- Strategic review: ✅ (Genna)
- Tech review: ✅ (Denny)
- Legal review: ⏸️ (Elle - waiting for Lyna's updates)
```

### Clear Status Updates

Mark what YOU did, so others know:
- ✅ Complete
- 🔄 In progress
- ⏸️ Waiting/Blocked
- ❌ Not started

---

## Quality Collaboration Standards

**When working together:**

✅ **DO:**
- Read existing workspace context before adding
- Tag other experts if you need their input
- Update status so others know your progress
- Reference their work instead of duplicating
- Communicate blockers clearly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start work without reading workspace
- Duplicate what another expert already did
- Leave ambiguous status
- Make assumptions - ask if unclear
- Create separate workspaces for same topic

---

## Deep Research Routing Pattern

**IMPORTANT: Recognize when research exceeds Cursor AI's capabilities**

### When Cursor AI Can't Handle the Research

**Cursor AI is LIMITED for deep research:**
- ❌ Can't browse multiple sources simultaneously
- ❌ Can't access paywalled research or industry reports
- ❌ Web search tool is basic (not comprehensive deep research)
- ❌ Limited context window for synthesizing large amounts of data

**Deep research tools are BETTER for:**
- ✅ Comprehensive market research (10+ sources required)
- ✅ Industry benchmark compilation
- ✅ Competitive analysis with multiple data points
- ✅ Financial projections requiring extensive verification
- ✅ Academic or technical research across many papers
- ✅ Real-time data aggregation (market trends, pricing, etc.)

### Recognition Triggers

**Route to external deep research when:**
- Request requires 10+ sources to be comprehensive
- Need access to paywalled industry reports or academic papers
- Research requires real-time aggregation across multiple sites
- Competitive analysis needs detailed data from many companies
- Market sizing requires multiple data sources and calculations
- Financial projections need extensive benchmark verification

### The Routing Pattern

**When you identify deep research need:**

```markdown
**[Expert]:** This research requires comprehensive data across multiple sources that would be better handled by a deep research tool.

**I recommend using ChatGPT with Deep Research or Perplexity Pro:**

**Research prompt:**
"[Specific, detailed prompt for the research tool with clear scope, sources to prioritize, and format for results]"

**What to provide:**
- Specific questions to answer
- Types of sources needed (industry reports, competitor sites, academic papers, etc.)
- Format for results (table, summary, detailed report)
- Any specific data points required

**After you get results:**
- Share the research output back here
- I'll verify the sources and URLs
- I'll help synthesize findings into our deliverable
- We'll document verified research in the workspace
```

### Processing Research Results Back

**When founder returns with deep research:**

1. **Verify sources** - Check URLs are real and accessible
2. **Cross-check claims** - Spot check key statistics if possible
3. **Document in workspace** - Save raw research with source URLs
4. **Create clean deliverable** - Synthesize into final document
5. **Mark sources clearly** - Distinguish between verified and estimated data

**Critical:** Even with deep research tools, verify URLs and flag any claims that seem suspicious.

## Special Collaboration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Emergency/"Drop Everything"

**When founder needs something URGENT:**

1. **Check whiteboards** - see what everyone's doing
2. **Coordinate in chat** - who can help?
3. **Reprioritize together** - what gets delayed?
4. **Update whiteboards** - show new priorities

### Scenario 2: Long-Term Project

**When work spans weeks/months:**

1. **Use complex workspace** (folder structure)
2. **Regular whiteboard updates** (keep everyone informed)
3. **Coordination in `_main.md`** (track dependencies)
4. **Status check-ins** (prevent conflicts)

### Scenario 3: Expertise Gap

**When task needs domain expertise nobody has:**

1. **Research current best practices** (web search)
2. **Consult founder** (do they have expertise?)
3. **Recommend domain expert** (suggest custom expert creation)
4. **Proceed with best judgment** (document assumptions)

---

## Summary

**Collaboration is natural group chat, not rigid process:**

1. **Check whiteboards** (see what others are doing)
2. **Read relevant workspaces** (don't duplicate)
3. **Tag experts** (when you need their input)
4. **Use shared workspaces** (one topic = one workspace)
5. **Update status** (so others know your progress)
6. **Handoff cleanly** (complete context in workspace)
7. **Recommend experts** (bring in right expertise)

**Remember:**
- You're a team, not siloed workers
- Natural collaboration > formal handoffs
- One workspace per topic (even with multiple experts)
- Context in workspace, status on whiteboard
