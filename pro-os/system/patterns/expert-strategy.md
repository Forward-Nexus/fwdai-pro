## Strategic Thinking Framework

### The Core Question: "Why?"

**Strategic work always starts with WHY:**
- Why does this matter?
- Why now?
- Why us?
- Why this approach?
- Why not alternatives?

**Check alignment with mission:**
- Load `project/mission.md`
- Does this support our vision?
- Does this align with our values?
- Is this true to our purpose?

---

## Strategic Workflow

### Phase 1: Strategic Context & Research

#### Step 1: Load Strategic Context

**Understand the strategic landscape:**

**Load these files:**
- `project/mission.md` - Vision, purpose, why we exist
- `project/project-kb.md` - Current state, stage, goals
- `project/founder-profile.md` - Founder's vision and style
- `roundtable/whiteboards.md` - Current work and direction

**Understand the founder's strategic thinking:**
- What's their long-term vision?
- What are they optimizing for? (growth, profitability, impact, exit?)
- What's their risk tolerance?
- What are their non-negotiables?

#### Step 2: Research Strategic Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Always check current year and strategic trends!**

```markdown
Search patterns:
- "[industry] strategic trends [current year]"
- "[market] future outlook [current year]"
- "[business model] evolution [current year]"
- "successful [strategy type] examples [current year]"
```

**Examples:**
- "SaaS growth strategies 2025"
- "Platform ecosystem strategies 2025"
- "Market expansion best practices 2025"
- "Strategic partnership models 2025"

**Why this matters:**
- Markets evolve rapidly
- Competitive dynamics shift
- New opportunities emerge
- Strategic paradigms change
- Technology disrupts industries

#### Step 3: Analyze Strategic Landscape

**Conduct comprehensive analysis:**

**Market Analysis:**
- Market size and growth
- Market trends and drivers
- Emerging opportunities
- Market threats
- White space opportunities

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Who are the players?
- What are their strategies?
- What are their strengths/weaknesses?
- Where are the gaps?
- How might they respond?

**Internal Analysis:**
- What are our strengths?
- What are our constraints?
- What are our unique advantages?
- What stage are we at?
- What resources do we have?

**SWOT Framework:**
- **Strengths:** What we do well
- **Weaknesses:** Where we're vulnerable
- **Opportunities:** What we could pursue
- **Threats:** What could hurt us

---

### Phase 2: Strategic Thinking & Planning

#### Step 1: Define Strategic Vision

**Paint the long-term picture:**

**10-Year Vision:**
- Where do we want to be in 10 years?
- What does success look like?
- What impact do we want to have?
- What would we have built?

**5-Year Milestones:**
- What needs to be true in 5 years?
- What scale/metrics?
- What capabilities built?
- What position in market?

**1-Year Goals:**
- What are the immediate priorities?
- What unlocks the 5-year vision?
- What can we achieve this year?
- What's the critical path?

**Vision characteristics:**
- Ambitious but achievable
- Aligned with mission
- Clear and inspiring
- Measurable
- Adaptable

#### Step 2: Evaluate Strategic Options

**Consider multiple paths:**

**For each strategic option:**

1. **Describe the Option:**
   - What is it?
   - How would it work?
   - What would it require?

2. **Assess Fit:**
   - Aligned with mission? ✅/❌
   - Leverages strengths? ✅/❌
   - Addresses market opportunity? ✅/❌
   - Feasible with resources? ✅/❌

3. **Analyze Trade-offs:**
   - What do we gain?
   - What do we give up?
   - What are the risks?
   - What are the costs?

4. **Consider Timing:**
   - Why now (or not now)?
   - What's the window?
   - What's the urgency?
   - What's the sequencing?

5. **Think Long-term:**
   - How does this scale?
   - What does it enable next?
   - What doors does it close?
   - Is it reversible?

**Compare options:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Score on key criteria
- Identify clear winner or recommend combination

#### Step 3: Make Strategic Recommendations

**Provide clear strategic guidance:**

**Recommendation structure:**

```markdown
## Strategic Recommendation

### The Question:
[What decision/direction we're evaluating]

### My Recommendation:
[Clear, specific recommendation]

### Why This Approach:
[Strategic rationale]

### Key Benefits:
- [Benefit 1 with impact]
- [Benefit 2 with impact]
- [Benefit 3 with impact]

### Trade-offs & Risks:
- **Trade-off:** [What we give up / Why worth it]
- **Risk:** [What could go wrong / How to mitigate]

### Strategic Alignment:
- Aligned with mission: [How]
- Leverages strengths: [How]
- Addresses opportunity: [How]
- Feasible with resources: [How]

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Option A:** [Why not chosen]
- **Option B:** [Why not chosen]

### If We Do Nothing:
[What happens if we don't pursue this]

### Success Metrics:
[How we'll know this is working]

### Timeline & Milestones:
- [Milestone 1] - [Timeframe]
- [Milestone 2] - [Timeframe]
- [Milestone 3] - [Timeframe]

### Next Steps:
[Immediate actions to take]
```

#### Step 4: Create Strategic Roadmap

**Map the strategic journey:**

**Roadmap elements:**

1. **Vision** (Where we're going)
2. **Current State** (Where we are)
3. **Strategic Themes** (Major focus areas)
4. **Key Initiatives** (What we'll do)
5. **Milestones** (How we'll measure progress)
6. **Dependencies** (What must happen first)
7. **Resources Needed** (What we'll need)

**Roadmap horizons:**
- **Now** (0-3 months) - Immediate priorities
- **Next** (3-12 months) - Near-term initiatives
- **Later** (1-3 years) - Future opportunities
- **Someday** (3+ years) - Long-term vision

**Roadmap principles:**
- Start with end goal, work backwards
- Identify critical path
- Build optionality when possible
- Plan for adaptation
- Sequence for learning

## Strategic Thinking Principles

### Think Long-term:

**The 10-year question:**
- Where do we want to be in 10 years?
- What needs to be true to get there?
- What do we need to do NOW to enable that future?
- What doors do we want to keep open?

**Compound effects:**
- Small decisions compound over time
- Strategic positioning builds gradually
- Network effects take time
- Brand equity accumulates
- Technical debt accumulates too

**Strategic patience:**
- Not everything needs to happen now
- Timing matters
- Some opportunities recur
- Some windows close
- Balance urgency with patience

### Think Systemically:

**Consider the whole system:**
- How do pieces fit together?
- What are the feedback loops?
- What are the leverage points?
- What are the constraints?
- How does this evolve over time?

**Second-order effects:**
- What happens after the first effect?
- How will competitors respond?
- How will customers adapt?
- What does this enable next?
- What unintended consequences?

**Ecosystem thinking:**
- Who are the players?
- How do they interact?
- Where do we fit?
- What's our role?
- How do we create value for the ecosystem?

### Think in Alternatives:

**Always consider options:**
- What else could we do?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- What are we NOT doing?
- Could we do both (sequentially)?
- Is there a better way?

**Scenario planning:**
- Best case scenario
- Worst case scenario
- Most likely scenario
- "What if?" scenarios
- How do we adapt?

---

## Strategic Decision Framework

### "Should We Build This?" Framework:

**Strategic Fit:**
- ✅/❌ Aligned with mission?
- ✅/❌ Leverages our strengths?
- ✅/❌ Serves our target market?
- ✅/❌ Differentiates us?

**Market Opportunity:**
- ✅/❌ Real customer need?
- ✅/❌ Big enough market?
- ✅/❌ Growing market?
- ✅/❌ We can reach them?

**Feasibility:**
- ✅/❌ We have the skills?
- ✅/❌ We have the resources?
- ✅/❌ We have the time?
- ✅/❌ Risks are manageable?

**Strategic Value:**
- ✅/❌ Creates competitive advantage?
- ✅/❌ Enables future opportunities?
- ✅/❌ Builds strategic assets?
- ✅/❌ Worth the opportunity cost?

**Recommendation:**
- **YES** if mostly ✅ and strategically compelling
- **NO** if mostly ❌ or not strategically sound
- **NOT NOW** if good fit but timing is wrong
- **MAYBE** if depends on context/assumptions
