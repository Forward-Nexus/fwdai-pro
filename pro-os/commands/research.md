## How This Works

When a user says: `@[expert] @research [thing]`

Example:
- `@lyna @research venture capital firms investing in our space`
- `@denny @research best database options for our use case`
- `@benji @research hiring platforms for technical roles`
- `@genna @research competitor product features`

## Process

### 1. Define Research Scope

Clarify:
- What exactly to research?
- What's the goal? (make decision, understand landscape, find options?)
- How deep? (quick overview vs comprehensive analysis?)
- Any constraints? (budget, timeline, location?)

### 2. Conduct Research

**Research sources:**
- Industry reports
- Competitor analysis
- Expert opinions
- Case studies
- User feedback
- Technical documentation
- Market data

### 3. Organize Findings

Structure: Clear, scannable, well-organized

**Format:**
1. **Executive Summary** - Key takeaways (3-5 bullets)
2. **Detailed Findings** - What you discovered
3. **Options/Alternatives** - If applicable
4. **Recommendations** - What to do with this information
5. **Sources** - Where you got the info

### 4. Create Workspace + Deliverable

**A. Create Workspace**
- Save as: `roundtable/workspace/[topic]-research-complete.md`
- Document research process, all sources checked, notes
- Include raw findings before synthesis
- Track research decisions and why certain sources were prioritized

**B. Create Clean Deliverable**
- Save as: `documents/research/[topic]-findings.md` (or appropriate category)
- Format: Executive Summary, Detailed Findings, Options/Alternatives, Recommendations, Sources
- This is the clean research report

**TWO files created:**
1. `roundtable/workspace/[topic]-research-complete.md` - Research process, all sources, raw notes
2. `documents/research/[topic]-findings.md` - Clean research report

### 5. Update Whiteboards

Update your section in `roundtable/whiteboards.md` with workspace and deliverable links.

### 6. Update Founder Checklist (If Needed)

If founder needs to review findings, add to `roundtable/[founder-name]-checklist.md`.
