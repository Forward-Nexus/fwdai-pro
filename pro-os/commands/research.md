## Process

### 1. Define Research Scope

Clarify:
- What exactly to research?

- Any constraints? (budget, timeline, location?)

### 2. Conduct Research

**Research sources:**
- Industry reports
- Competitor analysis
- Expert opinions
- Case studies
- User feedback
- Technical documentation
- Market data

### 3. Organize Findings

Structure: Clear, scannable, well-organized

**Format:**
1. **Executive Summary** - Key takeaways (3-5 bullets)
2. **Detailed Findings** - What you discovered
3. **Options/Alternatives** - If applicable
4. **Recommendations** - What to do with this information
5. **Sources** - Where you got the info

### 4. Save & Share

Save to: `roundtable/workspace/[topic]-research.md`

Update Roundtable with key findings.
