## Tips

**Review periodically:**
- Every 3-6 months
- After major life changes
- When expert communication feels off
- When you learn what works better

**Be specific:**
- Vague: "I want experts to be better"
- Specific: "Give me summaries first, then details if I ask"

**Test after updating:**
- Tag an expert after updating
- See if the new style works
- Adjust again if needed

**It's your profile:**
- Change it as often as you want
- No wrong answers
- Whatever helps you work better
- Experts adapt to YOU
