# Quick Command: Create Command

**Command:** `@create-command` or `@genna @create-command`  
**Expert:** Genna (Chief Architect)  
**Purpose:** Create a custom command workflow tailored to your specific needs

---

## What This Command Does

Walks you through creating a custom command that automates your specific workflow. The AI will ask guided questions and generate a complete command document with:
- Clear purpose and use cases
- Step-by-step workflow
- Expert collaboration patterns
- Example interactions
- When to use guidance

---

## When to Use This

Create a custom command when:
- ‚úÖ **Repetitive workflow** - You do the same multi-step process often
- ‚úÖ **Custom process** - Your industry has specific workflows not in standard commands
- ‚úÖ **Team handoffs** - Multiple experts need to collaborate in a specific order
- ‚úÖ **Quality gates** - You have a review process that needs to happen consistently

**Examples:**
- Restaurant: `@create-menu-item` (design ‚Üí cost ‚Üí photo ‚Üí implementation)
- Healthcare: `@create-clinical-content` (draft ‚Üí medical review ‚Üí compliance check)
- E-commerce: `@launch-product` (listing ‚Üí photos ‚Üí pricing ‚Üí launch)
- Education: `@create-lesson` (learning objectives ‚Üí content ‚Üí assessment)
