Current mission (from project/mission.md):

═══════════════════════════════════════

ODAT is a mobile app for addiction recovery support.

Through daily check-ins, progress tracking, and community 
support, ODAT helps people in recovery stay connected and 
accountable one day at a time.

Created: 3 months ago
Last updated: Never

═══════════════════════════════════════

This is pretty bare. Want to develop it further?

I can help you articulate:
  - Your personal "why"
  - The problem more deeply
  - Your vision for the future
  - What makes this different
  - What success looks like

Ready to develop your mission? [Yes] [Just update what's there]
> Yes
```

### Step 2: Ask Deep Questions
```
Genna:
Let's dig into your mission. I'll ask some questions to help 
you articulate what drives this project.

═══════════════════════════════════════

1. YOUR PERSONAL "WHY"

Why does THIS project matter to YOU specifically?

(This is powerful for investor pitches and team alignment)

> I spent 14 years trying to get sober and finally made it on 
9/26/24. I know how hard it is. Every day for a year I wished 
I had an app like this - something that understood "one day at 
a time" isn't just a saying, it's how you survive. I built what 
I needed, and now I want others to have it too.

That's powerful. Can I use this in your mission?
[Yes, use this] [Let me refine it] [Too personal, keep private]
> Yes, use this

═══════════════════════════════════════

2. THE PROBLEM (DEEPER)

Current: "addiction recovery support"

What's the REAL problem you're solving?

> People in recovery are alone. AA meetings are once a week, 
therapy is expensive, and between sessions you're on your own. 
When you're struggling at 2am, there's nothing. You need 
something EVERY DAY that knows where you are in your journey.

So it's not just "support" - it's daily companionship through 
the hardest journey of their lives?
> Exactly

═══════════════════════════════════════

3. YOUR SOLUTION (THE MAGIC)

What makes ODAT different from just "another recovery app"?

> Your AI companion. It's not just a chatbot - it's a life navigator 
who knows your story, meets you where you are, and helps you 
navigate ONE DAY. She celebrates day 3 differently than day 300. 
She remembers your triggers. She's WITH you.

Beautiful. This is your differentiator - the life navigation concept.

═══════════════════════════════════════

4. YOUR VISION (THE FUTURE)

If ODAT succeeds beyond your wildest dreams, what does that 
look like?

> Every person in recovery has an AI companion. Not just addiction - 
mental health, grief, chronic illness - anything where you 
need to navigate life one day at a time. Life navigation 
becomes accessible to everyone, not just people who can 
afford therapy.

So ODAT is the first step toward "life navigation for all"?
> Yes! Recovery is where we prove it works.

═══════════════════════════════════════

5. SUCCESS METRICS (WHAT MATTERS)

How will you know ODAT is working?

> When I hear someone say "I made it through today because 
of this app." That's it. If one person stays sober one more day 
because of this app, it's worth it.

(Plus: 10,000 users by Q1 2026, but the real metric is lives changed)

# ODAT: One Day at a Time - Mission & Purpose

## Why ODAT Exists

After 14 years of trying to get sober, I finally made it on 
September 26, 2024. I know how hard recovery is. Every day 
for a year, I wished I had an app like this - something that 
understood "one day at a time" isn't just a saying, it's how 
you survive.

I built what I needed. Now I want others to have it too.

## The Problem We're Solving

People in recovery are alone. AA meetings are once a week, 
therapy is expensive, and between sessions you're on your own. 
When you're struggling at 2am, there's nothing.

You need something EVERY DAY that knows where you are in your 
journey and helps you navigate it.

## How ODAT Works

ODAT provides daily companionship through the hardest journey 
of your life. Through your personal AI companion - 
ODAT offers:

- **Daily check-ins** that meet you where you are
- **Progress tracking** that celebrates every milestone
- **Personalized support** that knows your story
- **24/7 navigation** for the moments you need it most

The AI companion isn't just a chatbot. It's a life navigator that 
knows your story, remembers your triggers, and celebrates 
day 3 differently than day 300. She's WITH you.

## What Makes ODAT Different

The concept: Life navigation, not just recovery tracking.

Most recovery apps are journals or meeting finders. ODAT is a 
companion who navigates WITH you, one day at a time.

## Our Vision

Every person in recovery has an AI companion. Then we expand 
beyond recovery - to mental health, grief, chronic illness - 
anything where you need to navigate life one day at a time.

Life navigation becomes accessible to everyone, not just 
people who can afford therapy.

**Recovery is where we prove it works.**

## What Success Looks Like

When someone says: "I made it through today because of this app."

That's it. If one person stays sober one more day because of 
this app, it's worth it.

(Our goal: 10,000 users by Q1 2026. But the real metric is 
lives changed, one day at a time.)

## The ODAT Philosophy

**One Day at a Time** isn't just our name - it's our approach:
- Progress over perfection
- Daily support over weekly meetings
- Personalized navigation over generic advice
- Accessible help over expensive therapy
- Life navigation for everyone
