# Brainstorm Command

**Purpose:** Universal command for ideation and exploration - features, solutions, strategies, names, approaches, content ideas, etc.

---

## How This Works

When a user says: `@[expert] @brainstorm [thing]`

Example:
- `@genna @brainstorm product features for our MVP`
- `@lyna @brainstorm marketing campaign ideas`
- `@denny @brainstorm solutions for the scaling problem`
- `@benji @brainstorm ways to improve team collaboration`

---

## Process

### 1. Frame the Challenge

Clarify:
- What are we brainstorming?
- What's the goal/problem?
- Any constraints? (budget, time, tech, etc.)
- Any must-haves or must-avoids?

### 2. Load Context

Read:
- Project info (`project/` folder)
- Recent discussions (`0-ROUNDTABLE.md`)
- Related work (`roundtable/workspace/` handoffs)

### 3. Generate Ideas

**Brainstorming approach:**
- Start broad - quantity over quality initially
- Mix safe and bold ideas
- Build on previous ideas
- Consider different angles
- Don't filter too early

**Aim for:** 10-20 initial ideas, then narrow to 3-5 strong options

### 4. Evaluate & Refine

For each promising idea:
- **Pros:** What makes this good?
- **Cons:** What are the challenges?
- **Feasibility:** Can we actually do this?
- **Impact:** What's the potential value?

### 5. Present Options

**Format:**
```markdown
## Brainstorm: [Topic]

**Challenge:** [What we're solving]

**Context:** [Key constraints and goals]

---

### Option 1: [Name]
**The Idea:** [Clear description]

**Pros:**
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

**Cons:**
- [Challenge 1]
- [Challenge 2]

**Feasibility:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Potential Impact:** [High/Medium/Low]

---

### Option 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

---

## My Recommendation

[Which option(s) I think are strongest and why]

**Next Steps:**
- [What to do with these ideas]
```

### 6. Save & Share

Save to: `roundtable/workspace/[topic]-brainstorm.md`

Update Roundtable with options and ask for feedback.

## Brainstorming Techniques

### Divergent Thinking (Generate Ideas):
- What if...?
- How might we...?
- Opposite thinking (what if we did the reverse?)
- Analogy (how do others solve this?)
- Combination (merge two ideas)

### Convergent Thinking (Evaluate Ideas):
- Feasibility vs Impact matrix
- Must-have, should-have, could-have
- Risks vs Rewards
- Short-term vs Long-term value

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Generate first, filter later** - don't judge too early
- **Build on ideas** - "yes, and..." thinking
- **Go wide** - explore different angles
- **Be specific** - vague ideas aren't useful
- **Consider constraints** - but don't let them kill creativity
- **Recommend** - don't just list options, give your take

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Don't filter too early** - let ideas flow first
- **Don't only give safe options** - include bold ideas
- **Don't just list** - explain pros/cons
- **Don't skip evaluation** - help prioritize
- **Don't ignore constraints** - ideas must be feasible

---

## Collaborative Brainstorming

If multiple experts should weigh in:

```markdown
I've got some ideas, but this would benefit from multiple perspectives!

**Let's bring in:**
- @[expert1] for [their expertise]
- @[expert2] for [their expertise]

Want me to start a Roundtable brainstorm session? üé®
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Brainstorming

2. Generates 15 feature ideas
3. Evaluates each for MVP fit
4. Narrows to 5 strong options
5. Presents with pros/cons/feasibility
6. Recommends top 3 for MVP
7. Updates Roundtable
8. "Here are 5 strong features - I'd start with these 3!"

### Example 2: Marketing Ideas

## Notes

- **Quantity breeds quality** - generate many, pick the best
- **Context matters** - always consider project goals
- **Bold + Safe mix** - include ambitious and pragmatic ideas
- **Recommend** - don't make founder decide alone
- **Collaborate** - bring in other experts when valuable

**Remember:** Great brainstorming balances creativity with practicality. Generate freely, evaluate honestly, recommend confidently! üí°
