# @rt (Roundtable Review)

**Purpose:** All experts review a deliverable and provide feedback

**Experts:** Multiple (all relevant experts)

**Category:** Roundtable

---

## When to Use

Use this command when:
- You want multiple expert perspectives on something
- You need comprehensive review before launching/shipping
- You want to catch issues from different angles
- You need validation from the whole team

**vs individual expert review:**
- This command: All relevant experts weigh in, comprehensive feedback
- Individual review: Single perspective (still valuable!)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Identify What to Review

**Founder specifies:**
```
@rt pitch-deck
@rt auth-feature
@rt marketing-campaign
@rt legal-doc
```

### 2. Load the Deliverable

**Check where it is:**
- Workspace: `roundtable/workspace/[name].md`
- Deliverable: `documents/[category]/[name].md`
- Or founder provides file

### 3. Determine Relevant Experts

**Based on deliverable type:**

**Pitch deck → All business experts:**
- 🎯 Genna (strategic alignment)
- 🌐 Lyna (investor appeal, narrative)
- 📊 Benji (market/growth claims)
- ⚖️ Elle (legal compliance)

**Technical spec/feature → Technical experts:**
- 🎯 Genna (strategic fit)
- 🔧 Denny (technical soundness)
- 💻 Ada (implementation feasibility)
- ⚖️ Elle (compliance if needed)

**Marketing campaign → Growth experts:**
- 🎯 Genna (brand alignment)
- 🌐 Lyna (positioning, messaging)
- 📊 Benji (campaign strategy)
- ⚖️ Elle (legal compliance)

**Auto-detect relevant experts based on deliverable type!**

### 4. Each Expert Reviews

**Each relevant expert:**

**Step 1: Read the Deliverable**
- Open workspace (has context)
- Read deliverable itself
- Understand the goal

**Step 2: Review from Their Perspective**
- Genna: Strategic alignment, long-term fit
- Denny: Technical soundness, feasibility
- Ada: Implementation quality, maintainability
- Lyna: External appeal, positioning, narrative
- Benji: Growth potential, market fit
- Elle: Legal compliance, risk assessment

**Step 3: Add Review to Workspace**

Each expert adds their section:

```markdown
## [Expert]'s Review

**Overall:** [Looks great / Needs work / Major concerns]

**Strengths:**
- [What's working well]
- [What's working well]

**Issues/Concerns:**
- ⚠️ [Issue 1] - [Why it matters]
- ⚠️ [Issue 2] - [Why it matters]

**Recommendations:**
1. [Priority recommendation]
2. [Priority recommendation]

**Approval:** [Approved / Approved with changes / Needs revision]
```

### 5. Synthesize Feedback

**After all experts review:**

Create summary in workspace:

```markdown
## Roundtable Review Summary

**Reviewed by:** [List of experts]

**Overall Consensus:** [Strong approval / Conditional approval / Needs work]

**Key Strengths:**
- [What multiple experts praised]

**Key Issues to Address:**

   - Impact: [Why it matters]
   - Recommendation: [How to fix]

2. **[Issue]** - Raised by [expert(s)]

```
