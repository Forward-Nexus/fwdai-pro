# @[command-name]

**Purpose:** [Clear one-sentence description of what this command does]

**Expert:** [Which expert handles this - or "Multiple" if roundtable]

**Category:** [Technical / Business / Growth / Legal / Roundtable]

---

## When to Use

Use this command when:
- [Specific scenario 1]
- [Specific scenario 2]
- [Specific scenario 3]

**vs using `@create [thing]`:**
- This command: [Specific advantage - optimized workflow, knows exact questions, etc.]
- Universal command: [Still works, but more generic]

## How It Works

### 1. Smart Questions (Context-Aware)

**Check what we already know:**
- If `project-kb.md` has [relevant info] → Don't ask
- If we just did [similar task] → Reference it
- If `founder-profile.md` has [preferences] → Use them

**Required questions (always ask if not known):**
- [ ] [Question 1]
- [ ] [Question 2]

**Optional questions (ask only if needed):**
- [ ] [Conditional question 1] (when?)
- [ ] [Conditional question 2] (when?)

**Never ask if we already know it from context!**

### 2. Load Context (Token Efficiency!)

**Check what's already in context first!**

If NOT in context, read:
- `project/founder-profile.md`
- `project/project-kb.md`
- `project/mission.md` (if relevant)
- `roundtable/whiteboards.md`
- [Any other specific files for this task]

### 3. Search Current Best Practices

**ALWAYS search for current information:**
- "[current year] best practices for [topic]"
- "[current year] [industry] standards for [deliverable]"
- "Latest [technology/approach] patterns [current year]"

**Don't rely on outdated information!**

### 4. Follow Optimized Workflow

**Step 1: [First step]**
- [Specific action]
- [Why this matters for THIS task]

**Step 2: [Second step]**
- [Specific action]
- [Why this matters for THIS task]

**Step 3: Create Workspace + Deliverable**
- Create `roundtable/workspace/[name].md` (collaboration)
- Create `documents/[category]/[name].md` (clean output)
- Document process and decisions IN workspace

**Step 4: Quality Check**
- Run checklist: `system/checklists/[appropriate-checklist].md`
- Verify: [Specific quality criteria for THIS deliverable]

**Step 5: Update Roundtable**
- Update `roundtable/whiteboards.md` (expert section)
- Add to `roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md` (if review needed)

### 5. Deliverable Location

**Workspace:** `roundtable/workspace/[descriptive-name].md`  
**Deliverable:** `documents/[category]/[name].md`  
(AI organizes intuitively, founder can override)

## What Makes This Quick Command Different

**Optimizations for THIS task:**
- [Specific optimization 1]
- [Specific optimization 2]
- [Specific optimization 3]

**Smart defaults:**
- [What it knows/assumes for this type of work]

**Efficiency gains:**
- [How this saves time vs universal command]
