## When to Use

Use this command when:
- You need to raise funding
- You're pitching to VCs, angels, or investors
- You want a compelling, professional investor presentation

**vs using `@lyna @create pitch deck`:**
- This command: Optimized pitch workflow, knows exact investor questions, searches current pitch trends
- Universal command: Still works, but more generic

---

## How It Works

### 1. Smart Questions (Context-Aware)

**Check what we already know:**
- If `project-kb.md` has traction metrics ‚Üí Use them
- If `mission.md` exists ‚Üí Use for problem/solution
- If `founder-profile.md` has investor preferences ‚Üí Tailor to them

**Required questions (always ask if not known):**
- [ ] Who's the audience? (VCs, angels, seed funds, series A, etc.)
- [ ] What stage? (Pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.)
- [ ] How much are you raising?

**Optional questions (ask only if needed):**
- [ ] Any specific investor focus? (if targeting specific VCs)
- [ ] Traction to highlight? (if not in project-kb)
- [ ] Team to feature? (if not in founder-profile)
- [ ] Competitive advantages? (if not obvious from context)

**Never ask if we already know it from context!**

### 2. Load Context (Token Efficiency!)

**Check what's already in context first!**

If NOT in context, read:
- `project/founder-profile.md` (team, background)
- `project/project-kb.md` (traction, metrics, stage)
- `project/mission.md` (vision, problem, solution)
- `roundtable/whiteboards.md`
- Any existing pitch materials in `documents/investor/`

### 3. Search Current Best Practices

**ALWAYS search for current information:**
- "[current year] pitch deck best practices"
- "[current year] VC pitch deck trends"
- "[stage] pitch deck examples [current year]"
- "[current year] investor presentation standards"

**Example searches:**
- "2025 seed stage pitch deck best practices"
- "VC pitch deck trends 2025"
- "Y Combinator pitch deck format 2025"

### 4. Follow Optimized Pitch Deck Workflow

**Step 1: Understand the Context**
- Who's the audience? (different for VCs vs angels)
- What stage? (seed vs Series A needs different focus)
- What's the goal? (meeting, funding decision, warm intro)

**Step 2: Research Current Investor Trends**
- What are investors looking for in [current year]?
- What metrics matter for [stage]?
- What's the current fundraising environment?

**Step 3: Create Workspace + Deck**
- Create `roundtable/workspace/investor-pitch.md`
- Create `documents/investor/pitch-deck.md`
- Document strategy and decisions IN workspace

**Step 4: Structure the Deck**

Standard pitch deck flow (adapt based on research):
1. **Hook** - Compelling opening (problem or traction)
2. **Problem** - What problem exists? (make it real)
3. **Solution** - How you solve it (your product)
4. **Why Now** - Market timing and opportunity
5. **Market Size** - TAM/SAM/SOM
6. **Product** - How it works (demo if possible)
7. **Traction** - Proof it's working (metrics, growth)
8. **Business Model** - How you make money
9. **Competition** - Market landscape (you're different because...)
10. **Team** - Why you're the ones to build this
11. **Financials** - Revenue, burn, runway
12. **Ask** - What you're raising and why

**Step 5: Write with Impact**
- Lead with emotion for investor presentations
- Support with data and credibility
- Tell a compelling story
- Keep slides visual and scannable
- Use founder voice (authentic, not corporate)

**Step 6: Quality Check**
- Run checklist: `system/checklists/content-checklist.md`
- Verify: Story is compelling
- Verify: Data supports claims
- Verify: Ask is clear
- Verify: Slide flow makes sense

**Step 7: Update Roundtable**
- Update `roundtable/whiteboards.md` (Lyna's section)
- Add to `roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md` for review

### 5. Deliverable Location

**Workspace:** `roundtable/workspace/investor-pitch.md`  
**Deliverable:** `documents/investor/pitch-deck.md`
