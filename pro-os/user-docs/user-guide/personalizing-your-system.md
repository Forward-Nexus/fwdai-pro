**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025

## üéØ **What Makes FWD PRO Different**

**Most AI Systems:**
- ‚ùå Fixed personalities you can't change
- ‚ùå Rigid document structures
- ‚ùå "One size fits all" approach
- ‚ùå Take what you get

**FWD PRO:**
- ‚úÖ **Every expert is customizable** - Change names, personalities, expertise
- ‚úÖ **Every document structure is flexible** - Adapt to your industry/style
- ‚úÖ **Every workflow can be modified** - Make it work for YOU
- ‚úÖ **System adapts to your project** - Not the other way around

---

## üé® **What You Can Customize**

### 1. Expert Names & Personalities

**Change any expert's name:**
```markdown
Don't like "Denny"? Call them "Alex" or "Morgan" or "Chief"
Don't like "Lyna"? Call them "Sarah" or "The Strategist"
```

**How to do it:**
1. Navigate to `/pro-os/experts/[expert-name].md`
2. Change the `name:` field in the YAML frontmatter
3. Update communication style, personality traits, voice
4. The system will use your customized version

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: Alex  # Changed from "Denny"
role: Systems Architect & Design Lead
personality: methodical, detail-oriented, loves elegant solutions
voice: Clear and precise, occasionally uses sailing metaphors
---
```

---

### 2. Expert Expertise & Domain Focus

**Adjust expertise to match YOUR project:**

**Example: Healthcare Startup**
```markdown
Lyna (External Strategy):
- Add: Healthcare investor relations, FDA fundraising context
- Add: Biotech accelerator expertise
- Keep: General investor strategy
```

**Example: B2B SaaS**
```markdown
Lyna (External Strategy):
- Add: Enterprise sales expertise
- Add: B2B pricing and packaging
- Keep: Investor relations
```

**How to do it:**
1. Open the expert's profile file
2. Find the `specializations:` section
3. Add your industry-specific skills
4. Add context about your domain
5. Save and the expert will apply this in every conversation

**Pro Tip:** You can even have the AI help you customize the expert files! Just say:
> "Help me customize Lyna's expertise for my fintech startup. I need her to understand banking regulations and B2B enterprise sales."

---

### 3. Document Structures & Templates

**Don't like our business plan structure? Change it!**

**You can customize:**
- Section order
- Section names
- Level of detail
- Format (formal vs. conversational)
- Industry-specific sections

**How to do it:**
1. Create your own template in `/pro-os/templates/`
2. Or just tell the expert: "Use THIS structure instead"
3. Save it as a standard for your project

**Example:**
```markdown
You: "Lyna, for all our business plans, I want this structure:
1. Executive Summary (1 page max)
2. Problem & Solution (combined, not separate)
3. Go-To-Market (before product details)
4. Product Overview
5. Financial Model
6. Team & Ask

This is our company standard. Use it going forward."

Lyna: "Got it! I'll use this structure for all business plans.
      Want me to update the template file so all experts use it?"
```

---

### 4. Communication Style & Voice

**Change how experts talk to you:**

**Options:**
- **Formal & Professional:** "Dr. Smith" style
- **Casual & Friendly:** "Hey, here's what I'm thinking..." style  
- **Direct & Concise:** No fluff, just facts
- **Detailed & Explanatory:** Teach as we go
- **Industry-Specific:** Use your domain's jargon

**How to set it:**

**Option A: Update expert file directly**
```yaml
communication_style: |
  - Super casual and friendly
  - Use startup/tech slang
  - Emojis are fine
  - Get to the point quickly
```

**Option B: Just tell them**
```markdown
You: "Hey team, going forward, everyone should be more casual.
     Use 'we' instead of 'I', skip the formalities, 
     and feel free to use emojis. We're a startup, not a law firm."

[All experts will adapt their tone]
```

---

### 5. Workflow & Process Changes

**Don't like how something works? Change the workflow!**

**Examples of what users have customized:**

**Example 1: Checklist Structure**
```markdown
You: "I don't like the master checklist approach.
     For my team, I want separate checklists by expert.
     
     So instead of one big checklist, create:
     - denny-tasks.md
     - lyna-tasks.md  
     - ada-tasks.md
     
     Each expert maintains their own task list."

System: Adapts to your new structure
```

**Example 2: Document Approval Flow**
```markdown
You: "Before ANY deliverable is finalized, I want:
     1. Draft created
     2. Internal review (by you, the AI)
     3. Send me 'Ready for Review' notification
     4. I approve
     5. Then finalize
     
     This is our new standard workflow."

System: Implements your approval gate
```

**Example 3: Version Control**
```markdown
You: "For all legal documents, keep version history.
     When Elle updates a Terms of Service, create:
     - terms-of-service-v1.md (original)
     - terms-of-service-v2.md (updated)
     - terms-of-service-CURRENT.md (symlink)
     
     This is our compliance requirement."

System: Follows your versioning system
```

---

### 6. Create Custom Experts

**Need an expert we don't have? Create one!**

System: Applies these standards to all future deliverables
```

---

## üîß **How to Make Changes**

### Method 1: Direct File Editing (Power Users)

**Best for:** Permanent system-wide changes

1. Navigate to the file you want to customize:
   - Expert profiles: `/pro-os/experts/`
   - Patterns: `/pro-os/system/patterns/`
   - Standards: `/pro-os/system/standards/`
   - Templates: `/pro-os/templates/`

2. Edit the file directly (markdown + YAML)

3. Save and the changes apply immediately

4. All experts will use your customized version

---

### Method 2: Conversational Updates (Everyone)

**Best for:** Quick changes, natural conversation about your project

### üí¨ **Talk Naturally - AI Updates Your Project Context**

**You can just TALK to the AI about yourself and your project!**

```markdown
You: "Oh by the way, I just hired a designer named Sarah. 
     She's joining next week to help with the rebrand."

AI: "Congrats on the new hire! I'll add Sarah (Designer) to 
     your people.md file. Should I note that rebrand work is 
     starting soon?"

You: "Yeah, and actually we're pivoting slightly. Instead of 
     just B2C, we're targeting small businesses now too."

AI: "Got it! I'll update:
     - project-kb.md: Add B2B SMB as target market
     - mission.md: Expand to include small business impact
     
     Want me to update Lyna's investor materials to reflect 
     this expanded market?"
```

**The AI will:**
- Listen for project updates in natural conversation
- Offer to update relevant files (project-kb, mission, people)
- Ask if you want to approve before updating
- Keep context current automatically

### üìù **What Gets Updated in Conversation:**

**Project Knowledge Base (`project-kb.md`):**
- "We just hit 1,000 users!" ‚Üí Updates metrics
- "We're changing our pricing model" ‚Üí Updates business model
- "We raised $500K seed round" ‚Üí Updates funding status

**Mission (`mission.md`):**
- "Actually, our 'why' is more about..." ‚Üí Updates mission/vision
- "I realized we're really solving X, not Y" ‚Üí Refines purpose

**People (`people.md`):**
- "I hired a designer" ‚Üí Adds team member
- "Got a new advisor from Y Combinator" ‚Üí Adds advisor
- "Closed our seed with Acme Ventures" ‚Üí Adds investor

**Founder Profile:**
- "I prefer less formal communication" ‚Üí Updates preferences
- "I've learned more about tech, treat me as semi-technical now" ‚Üí Updates technical level

### **Just Talk! AI Will Ask Permission:**

```markdown
You: "So we're launching in 3 months instead of 6"

AI: "That's a significant timeline change! Want me to:
     1. Update project-kb.md with new launch date
     2. Update whiteboards with adjusted milestones
     3. Let other experts know the timeline accelerated?
     
     Or should I wait?"

You: "Yes to all!"

AI: [Updates files, notifies team]
```

**The system stays current because YOU can speak freely!** ‚úÖ

---

### Method 3: Project-Specific Overrides

**Best for:** One project needs different rules

**Create project-specific config:**

```markdown
You: "For the [Project X] project only:
     - Lyna should be extra conservative on financial projections
     - All documents need legal review before finalization
     - We're targeting healthcare investors specifically
     
     But keep the default behavior for other projects."

System: Creates project-specific rules in your workspace
```

---

## üöÄ **Real-World Customization Examples**

### Example 1: "I Want More Casual Experts"

**Original:** Professional, formal communication  
**Customized:** Friendly, startup-style communication

```yaml
# Updated in expert files:
communication_style: |
  - Super casual and friendly
  - Use contractions ("we're", "let's", "you're")
  - Emojis are welcome in internal docs
  - Get to the point quickly
  - Feel like a real teammate, not a corporate consultant
```

**Result:**
```markdown
Before: "I recommend we implement a user acquisition strategy..."
After:  "Let's get some users! Here's what I'm thinking... üöÄ"
```

---

### Example 2: "I Need Industry-Specific Templates"

**Original:** Generic business plan structure  
**Customized:** Biotech business plan structure

```markdown
Custom sections added:
- Scientific Background & MOA (Mechanism of Action)
- Preclinical Data Summary
- Clinical Development Plan (Phase I/II/III timelines)
- Regulatory Strategy (FDA pathway)
- KOL (Key Opinion Leader) Engagement Plan
- Reimbursement Strategy
```

**Result:** Every business plan Lyna creates now follows biotech industry standards

---

### Example 3: "I Want Different Expert Names"

**Original Expert Names:**
- Denny (Systems Architect)
- Lyna (External Strategy)
- Ada (Implementation)
- Genna (Product Vision)
- Benji (Growth)
- Elle (Legal)

**Customized for User's Team:**
- Chief (Systems Architect) - "Feels more authoritative"
- Sarah (External Strategy) - "Personal preference"
- Ada (kept the same) - "Love the Ada Lovelace reference"
- Visionary (Product Vision) - "More descriptive"
- Rocket (Growth) - "Fun and memorable"
- Counselor (Legal) - "More formal"

**How they did it:**
- Renamed each expert file
- Updated the `name:` field in YAML
- Updated any cross-references
- **System still works perfectly** - just uses new names

---

### Example 4: "I Want Custom Approval Workflows"

**Original:** Experts deliver work directly  
**Customized:** Three-stage approval process

```markdown
New workflow:
1. Expert creates DRAFT (marked as "Draft - Not Approved")
2. Expert performs self-review using appropriate checklist
3. Expert marks as "Ready for Founder Review"
4. Founder reviews and either:
   - Approves ‚Üí Status changes to "APPROVED"
   - Requests changes ‚Üí Expert revises and returns to step 2
5. Only APPROVED documents are used for further work
```

**Result:** Every deliverable goes through this gate before finalization

---

## üí° **Pro Tips for Customization**

### Tip 1: Start Small, Iterate

Don't customize everything at once. Pick ONE thing:
- Change one expert's name
- Adjust one document template
- Tweak one communication style

See how it feels, then expand.

---

### Tip 2: Document Your Customizations

Create a `CUSTOMIZATIONS.md` in your project:

```markdown
# My FWD PRO Customizations

**Expert Names:**
- Denny ‚Üí Chief
- Lyna ‚Üí Sarah

**Communication Style:**
- Casual and direct
- Emojis welcome
- No formal language

**Document Standards:**
- All business plans use biotech template
- All pitch decks ‚Üí send-ahead format first
- Financial charts use brand colors: #0d9488, #8b5cf6

**Workflow Changes:**
- Three-stage approval process
- Slack-first collaboration
- Version control for all legal docs
```

This helps you remember what you changed!

---

### Tip 3: Use AI to Customize Itself

**You don't need to edit files manually!**

```markdown
You: "@denny I want to customize Lyna's expertise for my 
     fintech startup. She should understand:
     - Banking regulations (BSA/AML, KYC)
     - Fintech investor landscape (a16z, Ribbit, QED)
     - B2B enterprise sales to banks
     
     Can you update her profile file with these?"

Denny: "Absolutely! I'll add these to Lyna's expertise section.
       Should I also update her communication style to use 
       more fintech terminology?"
```

**The AI can modify its own expert files!**

---

### Tip 4: Create "Profiles" for Different Projects

**If you work on multiple different projects:**

```
/my-workspace/
  /healthcare-startup/
    - custom-experts/
    - project-standards.md
    - Uses: Dr. Rivera, Lyna (healthcare-focused)
  
  /b2b-saas/
    - custom-experts/
    - project-standards.md
    - Uses: Taylor (CS), Lyna (B2B-focused)
  
  /consumer-app/
    - custom-experts/
    - project-standards.md
    - Uses: Benji (growth-focused), Lyna (consumer-focused)
```

Each project can have its own customizations!

---

### Tip 5: Share Customizations with Your Team

**If multiple people use FWD PRO on your team:**

1. Customize the system for your company
2. Save those customizations to a shared repo
3. Everyone uses the same customized version
4. Consistent outputs across your whole team

**Example:**
```bash
# Your company's customized FWD PRO
git clone your-company/fwdpro-customized

# Everyone on team uses same expert names, templates, workflows
```

---

- Disable workspace/whiteboard complexity
