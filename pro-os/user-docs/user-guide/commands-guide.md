# Commands Guide

**Complete reference for all FWD PRO commands with examples**

---

## Understanding Commands

Commands are pre-built workflows that help you work with experts efficiently. Think of them as structured templates for common tasks.

### Three Types:

1. **Universal Commands** - Flexible, AI-inferred workflows (create, execute, analyze, update, fix, research, brainstorm, plan)
2. **Flow Commands** - Structured, pattern-based workflows with enforced quality gates (create-specflow, execute-specflow, rt)
3. **System Commands** - Manage FWD PRO itself (update-project, create-expert, create-flow, etc.)

**What's the difference?**
- **Universal** = AI figures out the structure based on your request, flexible and adaptive
- **Flow** = Follows a specific predefined pattern with mandatory quality checks for consistency

---

## How Commands Work with Experts

**IMPORTANT:** Universal commands work with ANY expert. They don't "route" automatically.

**How to use commands:**

### Option 1: Tag an expert + command
```
@denny @create authentication spec
@ada @fix the login bug
@lyna @research seed funding landscape
```

### Option 2: Just describe what you need
```
I need a technical spec for authentication
Can someone fix the login bug?
Help me research the seed funding landscape
```

The AI will understand and engage the right expert based on context.

### Option 3: Use command standalone
```
@create authentication spec
@fix login bug
```

The AI will determine which expert should handle it based on your project context and active experts.

**Key principle:** YOU control who does the work by tagging them, or let AI route based on context.

---

## Universal Commands

Universal commands are flexible workflows that ANY expert can use. The expert you tag (or that AI selects) will adapt the command to fit the task.

---

### @create

## Flow Commands

Flow commands follow predefined patterns from `pro-os/system/patterns/` for consistent, high-quality workflows. They enforce specific structures like TDD and mandatory QA.

**When to use Flow vs Universal:**
- **Flow** = Need rigorous structure and enforced quality gates
- **Universal** = Need flexibility and quick iteration

---

### @create-specflow

**Purpose:** Create technical specification with TDD structure enforcement

**Pattern:** `patterns/spec.md`  
**Primary Expert:** Denny (but any technical expert can run it)

**Usage:**
```
@create-specflow authentication system
@create-specflow payment processing
@denny @create-specflow real-time notifications
```

**Workflow (3 Phases):**

**Phase 1 - Pre-Flight:**
1. Load context (project files, existing specs)
2. Clarify requirements with founder
3. Search current best practices (always uses current year!)
4. Identify expert collaboration needs

**Phase 2 - Execution:**
1. Create spec with TDD task structure
2. Define acceptance criteria
3. Document technical decisions
4. Get expert reviews (security, feasibility)
5. Update based on feedback

**Phase 3 - Post-Flight:**
1. Quality check against `spec-checklist.md`
2. Update workspace file with complete context
3. Mark ready for `@execute-specflow`

**Output:** 
- `documents/tech/[name]-spec.md` - Comprehensive technical specification
- TDD task structure (test requirements defined BEFORE implementation)
- Ready for Ada (or any implementer) to execute

**Key Difference from @create:**
- Enforces TDD structure (tests first!)
- Mandatory expert reviews
- Structured quality gates
- Ready for direct execution

---

### @execute-specflow

**Purpose:** Implement technical specification with TDD + mandatory QA

**Pattern:** `patterns/spec.md` + `patterns/expert-tech.md`  
**Primary Expert:** Ada (but any implementer can run it)

**Usage:**
```
@execute-specflow auth-spec
@ada @execute-specflow payment-processing
```

**Workflow (3 Phases):**

**Phase 1 - Pre-Flight:**
1. Load and review spec
2. Clarify any ambiguities
3. Set up test environment
4. Plan implementation order

**Phase 2 - Execution (TDD ENFORCED):**
1. **Write tests FIRST** (for each task)
2. Run tests (they should fail initially)
3. Implement code
4. Run tests (until they pass)
5. Refactor if needed
6. Update progress in workspace

**Phase 3 - Post-Flight (MANDATORY QA):**
1. Run full test suite (must have 80%+ coverage)
2. Quality check against `code-checklist.md`
3. Linter/formatter checks
4. Update documentation
5. Mark complete in workspace

**Output:**
- Fully tested, production-ready code
- 80%+ test coverage
- Documentation updated
- QA completed

**Key Difference from @execute:**
- TDD strictly enforced (tests absolutely first!)
- Mandatory QA phase (cannot skip)
- Must pass quality gates
- Higher confidence in code quality

### @rt (Roundtable Review)

**Purpose:** Multi-expert collaborative review with natural group discussion

**Pattern:** `patterns/expert-collaboration.md` (Step 7: Group Chat Pattern)  
**Experts:** ALL relevant experts participate **simultaneously** (v2.1)

**Usage:**
```
@rt review the pitch deck
@rt review authentication spec
@rt should we pivot to B2B?
```

**What Happens (v2.1 Group Chat):**
1. All relevant experts load context **at the same time**
2. Each reviews from their domain perspective:
   - Genna: Strategic fit, big picture
   - Denny: Technical feasibility
   - Ada: Implementation complexity
   - Lyna: Investor/external appeal
   - Benji: Market fit, growth potential
   - Elle: Legal/compliance
   - Your domain expert: Industry best practices
3. **Experts discuss naturally with each other** (not sequential handoffs!)
4. Cross-validate each other's perspectives
5. You see authentic expert collaboration
6. Synthesized recommendations
7. Documented review in workspace

**What's New in v2.1:**
- âœ… **Parallel, not sequential** - All experts active together
- âœ… **Natural discussion** - Experts respond to each other
- âœ… **Cross-validation** - They catch each other's blind spots
- âœ… **You learn** - Watch experts debate tradeoffs

**Use When:**
- Major decisions requiring multiple perspectives
- Cross-domain review needed
- High-stakes deliverable
- Want to see experts collaborate authentically
- Want to catch issues from all angles

**Output:**
- Comprehensive multi-perspective feedback
- Consensus and dissenting views documented
- Clear next steps
- All reviews in workspace

### @create-expert

**Purpose:** Create a custom domain expert for your team

**Usage:**
```
@create-expert
@genna @create-expert
```

**Works with:** Any expert (commonly Genna)

**What It Does:**
Walks you through creating a specialized expert with guided questions:
- What's their name?
- What's their domain/expertise?
- What personality should they have?
- What should they review?
- What red flags should they catch?

Then generates a complete expert profile.

**Result:** Full expert file in `pro-os/experts/[expert-name-domain].md`

**When to Use:**
- Need specialized industry expertise
- Standard experts don't understand your domain
- Want someone to review work through specific lens

**See Full Guide:** `pro-os/commands/system/create-expert.md`

### @create-flow

**Purpose:** Create a custom flow command workflow

**Usage:**
```
@create-flow
@genna @create-flow
```

**Works with:** Any expert (commonly Genna)

**What It Does:**
Walks you through creating a custom structured workflow:
- What should we call it?
- What does it do?
- What are the workflow steps?
- Which experts are involved?
- What quality checks are required?
- What gets delivered?

Then generates:
- Flow command file in `pro-os/commands/flows/[your-flow].md`
- Pattern file in `pro-os/system/patterns/[your-pattern].md` (if workflow is unique)

**When to Use:**
- Have a repetitive multi-step process
- Need specific quality enforcement
- Domain-specific workflow
- Team coordination in specific order

**How It Works:**
1. AI walks you through workflow design
2. Decides if existing pattern fits OR creates new pattern
3. Generates flow command that references pattern
4. You can then use: `@your-flow [item]`

**Note:** This is NOT about copying templates manually - it's a guided AI-driven creation process.

**See Full Guide:** `pro-os/commands/system/create-flow.md`

## Tips for Using Commands

### 1. Tag the Expert You Want

```
@denny @create auth spec
@ada @fix the bug
@lyna @research VCs
```

Clear and explicit - you control who does the work.

### 2. Or Let AI Route

```
@create auth spec
â†’ AI routes to appropriate expert based on context
```

### 3. Plain Language Works

```
I need a technical specification for authentication
Help me research seed funding
Can someone fix this bug?
```

Commands are helpful but not required - just describe what you need!

### 4. Add Context

```
@denny @create auth spec for mobile app, need social login (Google/Apple), must be HIPAA compliant
```

More context = better output.

### 5. Use Flows for Rigor

```
@create-specflow authentication
@execute-specflow authentication
```

When you need bulletproof quality with enforced gates.

### 6. Add Favorites (Just Ask!)

Want quick access to commands?

```
"Add @create-specflow to my favorites"

### Not Sure Which Command?

Just describe what you need:
```
"I need help with authentication"
"Can someone fix this bug?"
"Help me create a pitch deck"
```

The AI will figure it out!

### Want to Change Approach Mid-Way?

Just say so:
```
"Actually, let's use @create-specflow instead for more structure"
"Can @lyna take over this research instead?"
```
