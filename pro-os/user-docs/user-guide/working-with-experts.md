## How to Tag Experts

### Direct Tag (Recommended)

```

### Multiple Experts

```
@denny @ada let's discuss authentication approach

→ Both Denny and Ada engage in conversation
```

### Roundtable (All Experts)

```
@rt review this feature spec

→ All active experts provide feedback
```

### Plain Language (AI Routes)

```
I need a technical specification for authentication

→ AI routes to Denny automatically
```

---

## Expert Collaboration

Experts work together, not in isolation.

### Example: Feature Development

**You:** `@create-feature user authentication`

**Genna:** Kicks off the workflow
> "Authentication feature - Denny will spec, Ada will implement, Elle should review for security."

**Denny:** Creates spec
> Working on auth spec. Questions: JWT or session-based? Social login needed?

**You:** Answer questions

**Denny:** Finalizes spec
> Spec complete. @ada ready for implementation. @elle please review security.

**Elle:** Reviews
> Security looks good. Add rate limiting on login attempts.

**Denny:** Updates spec
> Added rate limiting. @ada updated spec ready.

**Ada:** Implements
> Starting implementation Monday. Will take 3 days. Using Denny's spec.

**Ada:** (3 days later)
> Implementation complete. @denny please review architecture. Code in PR #123.

**Denny:** Reviews
> Architecture is solid. Approved! Ship it.

**All of this happens in Roundtable - you see the collaboration!**

---

## Expert Handoffs

Experts hand work to each other explicitly.

### On Whiteboards:

**Denny:**
```markdown
**Handoffs:**
- [x] Spec complete → Ada for implementation
- [ ] @ada please implement auth-spec.md
```

**Ada:**
```markdown
**Incoming:**
- [ ] Authentication (from Denny) - Starting Monday
```

**You can see the workflow progress!**

---

## When Experts Need You

Experts add items to your checklist when they need input.

### Your Checklist Example:

```markdown
# Your Action Items

## 🔥 High Priority

- [ ] **Approve auth spec** (from Denny)
  - He needs your approval to hand off to Ada
  
- [ ] **Provide user metrics** (for Lyna)
  - She needs this for pitch deck

## 📋 Regular Priority

- [ ] **Test staging deployment** (from Ada)
  - New feature ready to test
```

**Check this regularly!**

---

## Expert Communication Styles

Each expert has a unique personality:

**Genna:** Strategic, big-picture, thoughtful
> "Let's step back and think about the long-term implications..."

**Denny:** Technical, detailed, thorough
> "Here's the spec with three implementation options. Option 2 is most scalable..."

**Ada:** Practical, action-oriented, clear
> "I can start Monday. Will take 3 days. Need Denny's spec first."

**Lyna:** Persuasive, story-focused, investor-minded
> "Investors love traction stories. Your 1,200 users is compelling!"

**Benji:** Creative, growth-focused, experimental
> "Let's try 3 channels and see what works: Product Hunt, Reddit, cold email."

**Elle:** Careful, risk-aware, clear
> "You need GDPR compliance. Here's a checklist. For serious issues, hire a lawyer."

**Your Domain Expert:** (Depends on their specialty!)

## Expert Limitations

### What Experts Can Do:
- ✅ Create specs and plans
- ✅ Write code
- ✅ Provide guidance
- ✅ Review work
- ✅ Collaborate with each other
- ✅ Learn your project over time

### What Experts Cannot Do:
- ❌ Execute terminal commands (you do that)

- ❌ Make final decisions (you do that)
- ❌ Provide legal advice (Elle helps, but hire a lawyer)
- ❌ Replace human expertise (they augment it)

**Experts are AI - treat them as very smart advisors, not infallible oracles!**

## Getting the Most from Experts

### 1. Give Context

**Less helpful:**
```
@denny create a spec
```

**More helpful:**
```
@denny create an auth spec for our mobile app. We need social login (Google, Apple) and need to be HIPAA compliant since we're in healthcare.
```

### 2. Ask Follow-Up Questions

```
@denny this spec looks good, but can you explain the refresh token strategy?
```

### 3. Involve Multiple Experts

```
@denny @elle let's discuss HIPAA compliance for authentication
```

### 4. Check Whiteboards Regularly

See what experts are working on, what they need from you.

### 5. Update Context

```
@update-project

→ Experts always have current info about your project
```

---

## Troubleshooting Expert Issues

### Expert Doesn't Understand

**Solution:** Start fresh context
```
@newthread
→ Clears confusion, starts over
```

### Wrong Expert Responded

**Solution:** Tag the right one
```
Actually, @denny this is more your area
```

### Experts Disagree

**Solution:** Ask Genna to mediate
```
@genna @denny and @ada have different opinions on architecture. Can you weigh in?
```

### Need More Detail

**Solution:** Ask for it
```
@denny this spec is high-level. Can you add more implementation detail?
```

---
