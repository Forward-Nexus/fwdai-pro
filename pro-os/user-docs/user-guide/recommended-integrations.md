**Example Custom MCP Server:**
```typescript
// custom-crm-mcp-server.ts
import { MCPServer } from '@anthropic/mcp-sdk';

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: 'custom-crm',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: [
    {
      name: 'search_customers',
      description: 'Search CRM for customers',
      parameters: { /* ... */ }
    }
  ]
});
```

## üí° How Integrations Work with FWD PRO

### Example: Recharts with Lyna

```markdown
Lyna: "I'm creating your pitch deck and see you have financial 
       projections. Want me to generate visual charts?
       
       [Detects recharts installed]
       
       I can create:
       - Revenue growth chart (2024-2027)
       - User acquisition funnel
       - Unit economics visualization (LTV vs CAC)
       
       Should I add these to the deck?"
```

---

### Example: shadcn with Ada

```markdown
Ada: "I'm implementing the dashboard. I'll use shadcn components 
      for consistency and accessibility.
      
      [Browses shadcn MCP]
      
      Adding:
      - Card component for metrics
      - Chart component for analytics
      - DataTable for user list
      
      All components will match your design system."
```

---

### Example: Linear MCP with Genna

```markdown
Genna: "I've updated your product roadmap with Q1 2025 milestones.
       
       [Linear MCP detected]
       
       Want me to sync these to Linear as epics? I can:
       - Create initiatives with proper hierarchy
       - Link to project docs
       - Set target dates
       - Assign to cycles
       
       Sync to Linear?"
```
