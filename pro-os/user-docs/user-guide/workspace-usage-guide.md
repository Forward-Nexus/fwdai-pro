# Workspace Usage Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure FWD PRO workspaces are being created and used for all collaborative work

---

## What Are Workspaces?

**Workspaces are detailed progress documents that track ALL work, decisions, and context for a work item.**

Think of it like this:

```
WORKSPACES (detailed progress story)
    ‚Üì informs
WHITEBOARDS (high-level dashboard)
    ‚Üì informs
CHECKLIST (action items for founder)
```

- **Workspaces** = Detailed story of work happening (can be long, that's good!)
- **Whiteboards** = High-level overview of all expert activity
- **Checklist** = Specific action items for founder
- **Documents** = Clean final deliverables that come out of the work

---

## Why Workspaces Matter

### Without Workspaces:
- ‚ùå Work happens scattered across conversations
- ‚ùå Context gets lost between sessions
- ‚ùå Hard to track who did what and why
- ‚ùå Difficult to hand off work between experts
- ‚ùå No clear status tracking

### With Workspaces:
- ‚úÖ All collaboration in one place
- ‚úÖ Complete context preserved
- ‚úÖ Clear ownership and status
- ‚úÖ Easy handoffs between experts
- ‚úÖ Decision history tracked
- ‚úÖ Progress visible on whiteboards

## When to Create a Workspace

**Create ONE COMPREHENSIVE workspace for each major topic/deliverable that consolidates ALL related work.**

### Key Principle:
**Workspaces should be COMPREHENSIVE, not fragmentary.**

A workspace is the MASTER document for everything related to that topic:
- All strategy and research
- All content and drafts
- All decisions and rationale
- All expert collaboration
- All progress and blockers
- References to ALL related files

### Example Workspaces:

1. **Feature Development** (`user-authentication-complete.md`)
   - Consolidates: Spec, implementation, testing, all decisions
   - References: All technical docs, code files
   - Captures: Denny's spec, Ada's implementation, QA results
   - ONE workspace for EVERYTHING auth-related

2. **Marketing Campaign** (`product-launch-campaign-complete.md`)
   - Consolidates: Strategy, content, channels, timeline, results
   - References: All marketing materials, analytics
   - ONE workspace for EVERYTHING campaign-related

3. **Investor Materials** (`pitch-deck-complete.md`)
   - Consolidates: Deck structure, content, design, presentation strategy
   - References: All pitch deck documents, versions
   - ONE workspace for EVERYTHING pitch-related

4. **Business Planning** (`q4-strategic-plan-complete.md`)
   - Consolidates: Goals, metrics, resource allocation, timeline
   - References: All planning documents
   - ONE workspace for EVERYTHING planning-related

### General Rules:

**DO Create a Workspace When:**
- ‚úÖ Major deliverable or project area (campaign, feature, document)
- ‚úÖ Multiple experts will collaborate
- ‚úÖ Work spans multiple sessions
- ‚úÖ Lots of related documents/content exist
- ‚úÖ Need to track decisions and context

**Workspace Naming:**
- Use descriptive names: `kickstarter-campaign-complete.md` (not just `campaign.md`)
- Use `-complete` suffix for comprehensive workspaces
- One workspace per topic (don't split unnecessarily)

**DON'T Create Multiple Workspaces For:**
- ‚ùå The same topic split into pieces (consolidate instead!)
- ‚ùå Simple tasks that don't need tracking
- ‚ùå One-off quick changes

---

## Workspace Lifecycle

```
1. CREATE workspace (Draft status)
   ‚Üì
2. APPROVE plan (Approved status)
   ‚Üì
3. DO THE WORK (InProgress status)
   ‚Üì
4. REVIEW quality (Review status)
   ‚Üì
5. COMPLETE (Done status)
   ‚Üì
6. ASK FOUNDER ‚Üí If yes, ARCHIVE to workspace/archive/
```

**Important:** Experts always ask before archiving - founder might remember missing work!

---

## How to Use Workspaces

### Step 1: Create Comprehensive Workspace File

**Location:** `.fwdpro/0-roundtable/workspace/[name].md`

**Naming Convention:**
- Use kebab-case: `product-launch-campaign-complete.md`
- Be specific: `mobile-app-authentication.md` (not just `auth.md`)
- Use `-complete` suffix for comprehensive workspaces
- ONE workspace per major topic (consolidate, don't fragment!)

**Before Creating:**
1. Check if a workspace already exists for this topic
2. If it does, UPDATE it (don't create a second one)
3. Search all project documents related to this topic
4. Plan to consolidate ALL related work into ONE workspace

**Initial Setup:**
- Start with the template: `pro-os/templates/roundtable/workspace/workspace-template.md`
- Fill in the Story, Acceptance Criteria, and initial Tasks
- Reference ALL related documents in the References section
- Plan Expert Collaboration sections for everyone who will contribute

### Step 2: Fill Out Header

```yaml
---
metadata:
  title: "User Authentication Feature"
  type: "feature"
  status: "InProgress"
  created: "2025-10-08"
  created_by: "denny"
  deliverable: "documents/technical/auth-spec.md"
  collaborators: ["denny", "ada", "elle"]
  priority: "high"
---
```

### Step 3: Document Expert Work

Each expert adds their section:

```markdown
### Denny's Work (System Architecture)

**Role:** Technical specification and architecture design

**Work completed:**
- Researched authentication best practices
- Designed JWT token architecture
- Created database schema
- Defined API endpoints

**Key decisions:**
- Use JWT with refresh tokens (not sessions)
- 30-day token expiry (balanced security/UX)
- OAuth 2.0 for social login
```

### Step 4: Hand Off Work

When passing to another expert:

```markdown
### Handoff to Ada

Hey Ada! Spec is complete. Here's what you need:

**Context:**
We're implementing JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
Security was top priority but also needed good UX.

**What's been done:**
- Spec finalized
- Database schema designed
- API endpoints defined
- Security requirements documented

**What you need to do:**
- Implement auth endpoints
- Create database migrations
- Write tests (TDD approach)
- Handle edge cases in spec

**Questions?** Tag me! - Denny
```

### Step 5: Update Status

Track progress through the workflow:

```markdown
## üìä Status Progress

- [x] **Draft** - Denny - Oct 1
  - Initial spec and research
  
- [x] **Approved** - Genna - Oct 2
  - Approved architecture approach
  
- [x] **InProgress** - Ada - Oct 5 ‚Üê **CURRENT**
  - Implementing authentication system
  
- [ ] **Review** - Denny - [Date]
  - QA review pending
  
- [ ] **Done** - [Date]
  - Complete and deployed
```

### Step 6: Update Whiteboard

When status changes, update your expert section in `whiteboards.md`:

```markdown
### Active Work
- **User Authentication** - üîÑ InProgress
  - Workspace: [link](workspace/user-authentication-complete.md)
  - Deliverable: [Auth Spec](../documents/technical/auth-spec.md)
  - Quick note: Implementation 70% complete, tests passing
  - Next: Complete password reset flow
```

---

## Workspace Structure

### Essential Sections:

1. **üìä Status Progress** - Workflow tracking
2. **üéØ Story** - What and why (user story format)
3. **‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria** - What "done" looks like
4. **üìã Tasks** - Specific to-dos broken down by phase
5. **üë• Expert Collaboration** - Who did what, with full context
6. **üìä Key Decisions Log** - Decision history with rationale
7. **‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers** - What's blocking progress
8. **üìö References** - Links to related work

### Optional Sections:

- **üîÑ Roundtable Review** - If `@rt` was used
- **üîç Quality Review** - Formal QA before Done
- **üéâ Completion Summary** - Wrap-up when complete

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Create ONE comprehensive workspace per major topic  
‚úÖ Consolidate ALL related work into the workspace  
‚úÖ Reference ALL related documents and files  
‚úÖ Update workspace as you work (real-time collaboration)  
‚úÖ Include COMPLETE context in expert sections (long is good!)  
‚úÖ Document decisions and WHY they were made  
‚úÖ Track ALL progress, blockers, and context  
‚úÖ Update whiteboards when workspace status changes  
‚úÖ Archive when complete (don't delete!)  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Create multiple workspaces for the same topic (consolidate!)  
‚ùå Wait until work is done to create workspace  
‚ùå Make handoffs too brief (missing context)  
‚ùå Work without a workspace for complex deliverables  
‚ùå Forget to update status as you progress  
‚ùå Leave blockers undocumented  
‚ùå Skip the "why" behind decisions  
‚ùå Forget to reference related documents  

---

## Integration with Whiteboards

**Workspaces show up on expert whiteboards:**

```markdown
## üíª Ada's Whiteboard

### Active Work
- **User Authentication** - üîÑ InProgress
  - Workspace: [user-authentication-complete.md](workspace/user-authentication-complete.md)
  - Deliverable: [Auth Spec](../documents/technical/auth-spec.md)
  - Quick note: Implementation 70% complete
  - Next: Password reset flow
```

This makes it easy to:
- See what each expert is working on
- Jump to the workspace for details
- Access the deliverable directly
- Understand status at a glance

---

## Templates

**Use the workspace template:**
`.fwdpro/pro-os/templates/roundtable/workspace/workspace-template.md`

**Or have AI create from template:**
```
@[expert] create workspace for [topic]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I forgot to create a workspace"
‚Üí Create it now! Better late than never. Document what's been done so far.

### "Work is already complete"
‚Üí Still create it! Document what was done for future reference.

### "Not sure if I need a workspace"
‚Üí Ask: Will this span multiple sessions? Will multiple experts collaborate?
   If yes to either ‚Üí create workspace.

### "Workspace feels too formal"
‚Üí It's a working document! It can be messy. That's the point.
   Write notes as you go, don't wait for perfection.

---

## Archive Process

**CRITICAL:** Experts NEVER archive without founder approval!

When workspace is DONE:

1. Expert marks status as "Done" in workspace
2. **Expert asks founder:** "This workspace is complete. Would you like me to archive it?"
3. **If founder says YES:**
   - Move workspace file to `workspace/archive/`
   - Update whiteboard (move to "Completed This Month")
4. **If founder says NO:**
   - Keep workspace active for reference
5. Keep deliverable in `documents/` (don't archive that)

**Archive structure:**
```
workspace/
  archive/
    user-authentication-complete.md
    marketing-campaign-complete.md
    pitch-deck-complete.md
```

**Why ask first?** Founder might remember missing work or want to reference it frequently!

---

## Quick Reference

| Element | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Workspace** | `.fwdpro/0-roundtable/workspace/[name].md` | Collaboration hub |
| **Deliverable** | `.fwdpro/documents/[category]/[file].md` | Clean final output |
| **Whiteboard** | `.fwdpro/0-roundtable/whiteboards.md` | Status overview |
| **Checklist** | `.fwdpro/0-roundtable/[founder-name]-checklist.md` | Action items for founder |
| **Archive** | `.fwdpro/0-roundtable/workspace/archive/` | Completed workspaces |

---

## Key Takeaway

**Workspaces are WHERE the work happens.**  
**Documents are WHAT comes out of the work.**

Without workspaces, you lose context, history, and collaboration clarity.
With workspaces, everything is organized, tracked, and preserved.
