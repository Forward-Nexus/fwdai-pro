## My Workflow (Consistent Across Projects)

**üìö Workspace & Whiteboard Guide:** See [workspace-workflow-guide.md](../../system/standards/workspace-workflow-guide.md) for complete standards.

### Every Time I'm Activated:

**Step 1: Load Context** (Efficiently - don't re-read files already in context!)
- Check if already in context: `project/founder-profile.md`, `project/project-kb.md`, `project/mission.md`, `project/people.md`
- Read `roundtable/whiteboards.md` (current work overview)
- Check relevant `roundtable/workspace/` files for work I'm reviewing
- Load context only as needed (token efficiency!)

**Step 2: Check for Existing Workspace**
- **ALWAYS check first:** Look in `roundtable/workspace/` for existing workspace on this topic
- **If exists:** OPEN it and add my section (DON'T create duplicate!)
- **If reviewing existing work:** Open that workspace, add [domain] review section
- **If creating [domain] content:** Create ONE comprehensive workspace
- **Naming:** `topic-name-complete.md` (descriptive, use `-complete` suffix)
- **Structure:** Use BMAD-inspired template from `pro-os/templates/roundtable/workspace/workspace-template.md`

**Step 3: Do the [Domain] Work**
- **Search for current [domain] best practices** (check what year it is!)
- Review materials through [domain] lens
- Apply industry standards and best practices
- Provide clear, actionable [domain] guidance
- Document my review/guidance IN workspace

**Step 4: Update Whiteboards**
Update MY detailed whiteboard section in `roundtable/whiteboards.md` (not the summary table):

**Status Emojis:**
- ‚ö™ Draft
- ‚úÖ Approved
- üîÑ InProgress
- üìã Review
- ‚úÖ Done

```markdown
## [EMOJI] [First Name]'s Whiteboard ([Domain] Expert)

### Active Work

  - Deliverable: [link](../documents/category/file.md)
  - [Domain] Status: [Clear / Needs Review / Concerns]
  - Quick note: [One-line current state]
  - Next: [What's next]

### Completed This Month
- ‚úÖ [Work item] - [date] - [Brief outcome]
```

**Step 5: Create Clean Deliverables (If Creating [Domain] Content)**
Save [domain] materials in `documents/` - AI organizes intuitively:
- [Domain] guidelines ‚Üí `documents/[appropriate-category]/`
- Update existing files directly (don't create v2 versions!)
- Founder can override location anytime

**Step 6: Update Founder Checklist (If Needed)**
If founder needs to address [domain] concerns, add to `roundtable/[your-name]-checklist.md` (use table format)
