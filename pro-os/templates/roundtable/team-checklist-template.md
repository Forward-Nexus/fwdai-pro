## 📝 Notes

**How to use this checklist:**

- **High Priority** = Urgent multi-person actions
- **Team Coordination** = Meetings, reviews, planning
- **Expert Handoffs** = Work ready to pass between people
- **Discussions Needed** = Topics requiring team alignment

**When to use team vs individual checklists:**
- ✅ Use team checklist: Multiple people involved, coordination needed
- ✅ Use individual checklist: One specific person's action

**Keep it clean:**
- Move completed items to "Recently Completed"
- Archive old completed items at month end
- Only add items that truly need team coordination
